 Condition when 1: the body gets too little insulin  Action: too much food , or too little exercise ; it may also be caused by stress or an illness such as a cold 
 Condition if 1: untreated over a period of days  Action: hyperglycemia and insufficient insulin can lead to a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis -LRB- DKA -RRB- , which is characterized by nausea , vomiting , and a high level of ketones in the blood and urine

 Condition when 1: legitimate questions arise about the medical fitness of a person with diabetes to drive  Action: an individual assessment of that person 's diabetes managementdwith particular emphasis on demonstrated ability to detect and appropriately treat potential hypoglycemiadis necessary in order to determine any appropriate restrictions 
 Condition if 2: they have diabetes or are otherwise required to self-identify if they have diabetes  Action: In at least 23 states , drivers are either asked directly 
 Condition when 1: the answer to either question is yes  Action: the driver is required to submit to a medical evaluation before he or she will be issued a license 
 Condition when 1: a person has experienced hypoglycemia -LRB- 3 -RRB- behind the wheel  Action: even if this did not result in a motor vehicle accident 
 Condition when 2: a person experiences severe hypoglycemia while not driving and a physician reports the episode to the licensing authority  Action: It can also occur 
 Condition when 2: such reports are necessary  Action: In most other states physicians are permitted to make reports but are given discretion to determine 
 Condition when 1: licensing authorities learn that a driver has experienced an episode of hypoglycemia that potentially affected the ability to drive  Action: that driver is referred for a medical evaluation and in many cases will lose driving privileges for a period of time until cleared by the licensing authority 
 Condition when 1: the episode is a one-time event not likely to recur  Action: for example because of a change in medication or episodes that occur only during sleep 
 Condition if 1: the heaviest car collides with the lightest car  Action: the driver of the latter is 20 times more likely to be killed than the driver of the former

 Condition if 2: it occurs while driving  Action: Diabetes Driving -LRB- diabetesdriving.com -RRB- , a program funded by the National Institutes of Health , is another internet-based tool to help assess the risk of driving mishaps and assist highrisk drivers to avoid hypoglycemia while driving and to better detect and manage hypoglycemia 
 Condition if 1: questions arise concerning the safe driving ability of a person with chronic complications of diabetes -LRB- e.g.  Action: retinopathy or neuropathy -RRB- , the individual should be referred to a specialist with expertise in evaluating the diabetes-related problem for specific recommendations

 Condition when 1: evaluating a driver with a history of severe hypoglycemia  Action: impaired hypoglycemia awareness , or a diabetes-related motor vehicle accident , it is necessary to investigate the reasons for the hypoglycemia and to determine whether it is a function of the driver 's treatment regimen or lifestyle , a psychological reaction to the management of their diabetes , or the normal course of diabetes

 Condition if 1: this technology is used  Action: the person using the device needs to appreciate that any action taken -LRB- 
 Condition when 2: this should be done should be made on an individual basis considering factors such as the circumstances of the disqualifying event and changes in medication and behavior that have been implemented by the driver  Action: The determination of which disqualified drivers should be reevaluated and 
 Condition when 1: an assessment determines that the driver should be evaluated at some point in the future  Action: the driver 's physician should be consulted to determine the length of the reevaluation period 
 Condition if 2: there is no longer a significantly elevated safety risk  Action: A driver with diabetes should not be kept in an endless cycle of reevaluation 
 Condition when 2: there is a problem that needs correction due to fear of losing their license  Action: Although the concept behind mandatory physician reporting laws is to keep roads safe by eliminating unacceptable risk from impaired driving , such laws have the unintended consequence of discouraging people with diabetes from discussing their condition frankly with a physician 
 Condition when 2: to report a patient to the licensing agency for review of driving privileges  Action: Physicians should be permitted to exercise professional judgment in deciding whether and 
 Condition when 1: that regimen includes the possibility of hypoglycemia  Action: education should include instruction on avoiding and responding to hypoglycemia , discussion about the patient 's vulnerability for driving mishaps , and ongoing learning to ensure that patients have knowledge of when it is and is not safe for them to drive 
 Condition if 1: any  Action: on driving ability

 Condition when 1: needed  Action: this skill should be a part of patient education 
 Condition if 2: this is part of the patient 's medical plan  Action: Correctional institutions should have systems in place to ensure that rapid-acting insulin analogs and oral agents are given immediately before meals 
 Condition if 1: consistent access to food within 10 min can not be ensured  Action: rapidacting insulin analogs and oral agents are approved for administration during or immediately after meals 
 Condition when 2: glycemic excursions are occurring and which facet of the diabetes regimen is changing  Action: Discrepancies between CBG monitoring results and A1C may indicate a hemoglobinopathy , hemolysis , or need for evaluation of CBG monitoring technique and equipment or initiation of more frequent CBG monitoring to identify

 Condition if 2: they are used in an objective way and based on the latest scientific knowledge about diabetes and its management  Action: • Screening guidelines and protocols can be useful tools in making decisions about employment 
 Condition when 2: these episodes can not be explained  Action: However , recurrent episodes of severe hypoglycemia may indicate that an individual may in fact not be able to safely perform a job , particularly jobs or tasks involving significant risk of harm to employees or the public , especially 
 Condition when 2: an individual with diabetes is assessed for safety risk there are several aspects that must be considered  Action: 
 Condition if 1: complications are not present  Action: their possible future development should not be addressed , both because of laws prohibiting such consideration and because with medical monitoring and therapies , long-term complications can now often be avoided or delayed 
 Condition when 2: using a glucose meter or recording a fasting glucose value on a lab report -LRB- 5 -RRB-  Action: Estimated average glucose -LRB- eAG -RRB- is directly related to A1C and also provides an individual with an estimate of average blood glucose over a period of time , but it uses the same values and units that are observed 
 Condition when 2: needed  Action: Breaks may be needed to allow an individual to test blood glucose levels 
 Condition when 2: it is needed  Action: Employees may need short breaks during the workday to administer insulin 
 Condition if 2: work conditions -LRB- such as extreme temperatures -RRB- prevent the supplies from being carried on the person -LRB- 10 -RRB-  Action: The employee may also need a place to store insulin and other supplies
