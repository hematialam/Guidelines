 Condition2: implemented soon after the diagnosis of diabetes is associated with long-term reduction in macrovascular disease  Action: Glycemic goals in adults • Lowering A1C to below or around 7 % has been shown to reduce microvascular complications of diabetes , and 
 Condition2: this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment  Action: Providers might reasonably suggest more stringent A1C goals -LRB- such as < 6.5 % -RRB- for selected individual patients , 
 Condition1: noninsulin monotherapy at maximal tolerated dose does not achieve or maintain the A1C target over 3 -- 6 months  Action: add a second oral agent , a glucagon-like peptide-1 -LRB- GLP-1 -RRB- receptor agonist , or insulin 
 Condition2: the result of testing in the previous 2 -- 3 months is not available  Action: Consider obtaining an A1C on patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital 
 Condition1: the A1C is 7.0 % and a repeat result is 6.8 %  Action: the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed 
 Condition1: two different tests -LRB- such as A1C and FPG -RRB- are both above the diagnostic thresholds  Action: the diagnosis of diabetes is also confirmed 
 Condition1: a patient meets the diabetes criterion of the A1C -LRB- two results > = 6.5 % -RRB- but not the FPG -LRB- < 126 mg / dL or 7.0 mmol/L -RRB-  Action: or vice versa , that person should be considered to have diabetes 
 Condition2: implemented soon after the diagnosis of diabetes is associated with long-term reduction in macrovascular disease  Action: Glycemic goals in adults Recommendations • Lowering A1C to below or around 7 % has been shown to reduce microvascular complications of diabetes and 
 Condition2: this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment  Action: • Providers might reasonably suggest more stringent A1C goals -LRB- such as < 6.5 % -RRB- for selected individual patients , 
 Condition1: they can be achieved without excessive hypoglycemia : • premeal  Action: bedtime , and overnight glucose 60 -- 99 mg/dL -LRB- 
 Condition1: noninsulin monotherapy at maximal tolerated dose does not achieve or maintain the A1C target over 3 -- 6 months  Action: add a second oral agent , a glucagon-like peptide-1 -LRB- GLP-1 -RRB- receptor agonist , or insulin 
 Condition2: age-group is toddlers and preschoolers -LRB- 0-6 -RRB-  Action: Before meals plasma blood glucose range 100 -- 180 -LRB- mg/dL -RRB- , bedtime plasma blood glucose range 110 -- 200 -LRB- mg/dL -RRB- , and A1C < 8.5 % are goals for type 1 diabetes , 
 Condition2: age-group is school age -LRB- 6 -- 12 -RRB-  Action: Before meals plasma blood glucose range 90 -- 180 -LRB- mg/dL -RRB- , bedtime plasma blood glucose range 100 -- 180 -LRB- mg/dL -RRB- , and A1C < 8 % are goals for type 1 diabetes , 
 Condition2: age-group is adolescents and young adults -LRB- 13 -- 19 -RRB-  Action: Before meals plasma blood glucose range 90 -- 130 -LRB- mg/dL -RRB- , bedtime plasma blood glucose range 90 -- 150 -LRB- mg/dL -RRB- , and A1C < 7.5 % are goals for type 1 diabetes , 
 Condition2: the result of testing in the previous 2 -- 3 months is not available  Action: Consider obtaining an A1C on patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital 
 Condition1: the A1C is 7.0 % and a repeat result is 6.8 %  Action: the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed

 Condition1: the receiving facility is responsible for transporting the patient to that appointment  Action: and name and telephone/fax number of a contact person at the transferring facility who can provide additional information , if needed The medical transfer summary , which acts as a quick medical reference for the receiving facility , should be transferred along with the patient
