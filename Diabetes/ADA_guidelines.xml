Introduction
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has been actively involved in the development and dissemination of diabetes care standards, guidelines, and related documents for many years.</s> <s i="1">These statements are published in one or more of the Association’s professional journals.</s> <s i="2">This supplement contains the latest update of the ADA’s major position statement, “Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes,” which contains all of the Association’s key recommendations.</s> <s i="3">In addition, contained herein are selected position statements on certain topics not adequately covered in the “Standards.” ADA hopes that this is a convenient and important resource for all health care professionals who care for people with diabetes.</s>

<s i="4">ADA Clinical Practice Recommendations consist of position statements that represent official ADA opinion as denoted by formal review and approval by the Professional Practice Committee and the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors.</s> <s i="5">Consensus reports and systematic reviews are not official ADA recommendations; however, they are produced under the auspices of the Association by invited experts.</s> <s i="6">These publications may be used by the Professional Practice Committee as source documents to update the “Standards.”

ADA has adopted the following definitions for its clinically related reports.</s>

<s i="7">ADA position statement.</s> <s i="8">An official point of view or belief of the ADA.</s> <s i="9">Position statements are issued on scientific or medical issues related to diabetes.</s> <s i="10">They may be authored or unauthored and are published in ADA journals and other scientific/medical publications as appropriate.</s> <s i="11">Position statements must be reviewed and approved by the Professional Practice Committee and, subsequently, by the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors.</s> <s i="12">ADA position statements are typically based on a systematic review or other review of published literature.</s> <s i="13">They are reviewed on an annual basis and updated as needed.</s> <s i="14">A list of recent position statements is included on p. e3 of this supplement.</s>

<s i="16">ADA  scientific  statement.</s>  <s i="17">A scholarly synopsis of a topic related to diabetes, which may or may not contain clinical or research recommendations.</s> <s i="18">Any recommendations included represent the official point of view or belief of the ADA.</s> <s i="19">Work Group Reports fall into this category.</s> <s i="20">Scientific statements are published in the ADA journals and other scientific/medical publications as appropriate.</s> <s i="21">Scientific statements must be reviewed and approved by the Professional Practice Committee and, subsequently, by the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors.</s> <s i="22">A list of recent scientific statements is included on p. e4 of this supplement.</s>

<s i="24">Systematic review.</s> <s i="25">A balanced review and analysis of the literature on a scientific or medical topic related to diabetes.</s> <s i="26">Effective January 2010, technical reviews were replaced by systematic reviews, for which a priori search and inclusion/ exclusion criteria are developed and published.</s> <s i="27">The systematic review provides a scientific rationale for a position statement and undergoes critical peer review before submission to the Professional Practice Committee for approval.</s> <s i="28">A list of past systematic reviews is included on p. e1 of this supplement.</s>

<s i="30">Consensus report.</s> <s i="31">A comprehensive examination by a panel of experts (i.e., consensus panel) of a scientific or medical issue related to diabetes.</s> <s i="32">Effective January 2010, consensus statements were renamed consensus reports.</s> <s i="33">The category may also include task force and expert committee reports.</s> <s i="34">Consensus reports do not have the Association’s name included in the title or subtitle and include a disclaimer in the introduction stating that any recommendations are not ADA position.</s> <s i="35">A consensus report is typically developed immediately following a consensus conference at which presentations are made on the issue under review.</s> <s i="36">The statement represents the panel’s collective analysis, evaluation, and opinion at that point in time  based  in  part  on  the  conference proceedings.</s> <s i="37">The need for a consensus report arises when clinicians or scientists desire guidance on a subject for which the evidence is contradictory or incomplete.</s> <s i="38">Once written by the panel, a consensus report is not subject to subsequent review or approval and does not represent official Association opinion.</s> <s i="39">A list of recent consensus reports is included on p. e2 of this supplement.</s>

<s i="41">Professional Practice Committee.</s> <s i="42">The Association’s Professional Practice Committee is responsible for reviewing ADA systematic reviews, scientific statements, and position statements, as well as for overseeing revisions of the latter as needed.</s> <s i="43">Appointment to the Professional Practice Committee is based on excellence in clinical practice and/or research.</s> <s i="44">The committee comprises physicians, diabetes educators, registered dietitians, and others who have expertise in a range of areas, including adult and pediatric endocrinology, epidemiology, and public health, lipid research, hypertension, and preconception and pregnancy care.</s> <s i="45">All members of the Professional Practice Committee are required to disclose potential conflicts of interest (listed on p. S109).</s>

<s i="46">Grading of scientific evidence.</s> <s i="47">There has been considerable evolution in the evaluation of scientific evidence and in the development of evidence-based guidelines since the ADA first began publishing practice guidelines.</s> <s i="48">Accordingly, we developed a classification system to grade the quality of scientific evidence supporting ADA recommendations for all new and revised ADA position statements.</s>

<s i="49">Recommendations are assigned ratings of A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence (Table 1).</s> <s i="50">Expert opinion (E) is a separate category for recommendations in which there is as yet no evidence from clinical trials, in which clinical trials may be impractical, or in which there is conflicting evidence.</s> <s i="51">Recommendations with an “A” rating are based on large well-designed clinical trials or well-done meta-analyses.</s>

<s i="52">Introduction

Table 1
ADA evidence-grading system for clinical practice recommendations

Level of evidence		Description

A	Clear evidence from well-conducted, generalizable, randomized controlled trials that are adequately powered, including:

c Evidence from a well-conducted multicenter trial

c Evidence from a meta-analysis that incorporated quality ratings in the analysis

Compelling nonexperimental evidence, i.e., the “all or none” rule developed by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford

Supportive evidence from well-conducted randomized controlled trials that are adequately powered, including:

c Evidence from a well-conducted trial at one or more institutions

c Evidence from a meta-analysis that incorporated quality ratings in the analysis

B	Supportive evidence from well-conducted cohort studies, including:

c Evidence from a well-conducted prospective cohort study or registry

c Evidence from a well-conducted meta-analysis of cohort studies Supportive evidence from a well-conducted case-control study

C	Supportive evidence from poorly controlled or uncontrolled studies, including: • Evidence from randomized clinical trials with one or more major or Ćthree or more Ć   minor methodological flaws that could invalidate the results

c Evidence from observational studies with high potential for bias (such as case series with comparison to historical controls)

c Evidence from case series or case reports

Conflicting evidence with the weight of evidence supporting the recommendation 
E	Expert consensus or clinical experience

Generally, these recommendations have the best chance of improving outcomes when applied to the population to which they are appropriate.</s> <s i="53">Recommendations with lower levels of evidence may be equally important but are not as well supported.</s> <s i="54">The level of evidence supporting a given recommendation is noted either as a heading for a group of recommendations or in parentheses after a given recommendation.</s>

<s i="55">Of course, evidence is only one component of clinical decision making.</s> <s i="56">Clinicians care for patients, not populations; guidelines must always be interpreted with the needs of the individual patient in mind.</s> <s i="57">Individual circumstances, such as comorbid and coexisting diseases, age, education, disability, and, above all, patients’ values and preferences, must also be considered and may lead to different treatment targets and strategies.</s> <s i="58">Also, conventional evidence hierarchies, such as the one adapted by the ADA, may miss some nuances that are important in diabetes care.</s> <s i="59">For example, while there is excellent evidence from clinical trials supporting the importance of achieving multiple risk factor control, the optimal way to achieve this result is less clear.</s> <s i="60">It is difficult to assess each component of such a complex intervention.</s>

<s i="61">ADA will continue to improve and update the Clinical Practice Recommendations to ensure that clinicians, health plans, and policy-makers can continue to rely on them as the most authoritative and current guidelines for diabetes care.</s> <s i="62">Our Clinical Practice Recommendations are also available on the Association’s website at www.diabetes. org/diabetescare.</s>

<s i="88">Revisions to the National Standards for Diabetes

Self-Management Education and Support

c The task force report “National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support” represents a major revision completed in 2012.</s>

<s i="89">Executive Summary: Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes: 2013

Current criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes

c A1C >=6.5%.</s> <s i="90">The test should be performed in a laboratory using a method that is NGSP certified and standardized to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) assay; or

c fasting plasma glucose (FPG) >=126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L).</s> <s i="91">Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 h; or

c 2-h plasma glucose >=200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).</s> <s i="92">The test should be performed as described by the World Health Organization, using a glucose load containing the equivalent of 75 g anhydrous glucose dissolved in water; or

c in a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random plasma glucose >=200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L);

c in the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, result should be confirmed by repeat testing.</s>



<s i="93">Testing for diabetes in asymptomatic patients

c Testing to detect type 2 diabetes and prediabetes in asymptomatic people should be considered in adults of any age who are overweight or obese (BMI >=25 kg/m2) and who have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes (see Table  4  of the “Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes: 2013”). (B)</s> <s i="94">In those without these risk factors, testing should begin at age 45 years.</s> <s i="95">

c If tests are normal, repeat testing at least at 3-year intervals is reasonable. (E)</s> <s i="96">

c To test for diabetes or prediabetes, the A1C, FPG, or 75-g 2-h OGTT are appropriate. (B)</s> <s i="97">

c In those identified with prediabetes, identify and, if appropriate, treat other cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. (B)</s> <s i="98">

 

Screening for type 2 diabetes in children

c Testing to detect type 2 diabetes and prediabetes should be considered in children and adolescents who are overweight and who have two or more additional risk factors for diabetes (see Table 5 of the “Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes: 2013”). (E)</s> <s i="99">



Screening for type 1 diabetes

c Consider referring relatives of those with type 1 diabetes for antibody testing for risk assessment in the setting of a clinical research study. (E)</s> <s i="100">



Detection and diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus

c Screen for undiagnosed type 2 diabetes at the first prenatal visit in those with risk factors, using standard diagnostic criteria. (B)</s> <s i="101">

c In pregnant women not previously known to have diabetes, screen for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) at 24–28 weeks of gestation, using a 75-g 2-h OGTT and the diagnostic cut points in Table 6 of the “Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes: 2013.” (B)

c Screen women with GDM for persistent diabetes at 6–12 weeks postpartum, using the OGTT and nonpregnancy diagnostic criteria. (E)</s> <s i="102">

c Women with a history of GDM should have lifelong screening for the development of diabetes or prediabetes at least every 3 years. (B)</s> <s i="103">

c Women with a history of GDM found to have prediabetes should receive lifestyle interventions or metformin to prevent diabetes. (A)</s> <s i="104">



Prevention/delay of type 2 diabetes

c Patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (A), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (E), or an A1C 5.7–6.4% (E) should be referred to an effective ongoing support program targeting weight loss of 7% of body weight and increasing physical activity to at least 150 min/week of moderate activity such as walking.</s>

<s i="105">• Follow-up  counseling appears to be important for success. (B)</s> <s i="106">

c Based on the cost-effectiveness of diabetes prevention, such programs should be covered by third-party payers. (B)</s> <s i="107">

c Metformin therapy for prevention of type 2 diabetes may be considered in those with IGT (A), IFG (E), or an A1C 5.7–6.4% (E), especially for those with BMI >35 kg/m2, aged <60 years, and women with prior GDM. (A)</s> <s i="108">

c At least annual monitoring for the development of diabetes in those with prediabetes is suggested. (E)</s> <s i="109">

c Screening for and treatment of modifiable risk factors for CVD is suggested. (B)</s> <s i="110">



Glucose monitoring

c Patients on multiple-dose insulin (MDI) or insulin pump therapy should do self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) at least prior to meals and snacks, occasionally postprandially, at bedtime, prior to exercise, when they suspect low blood glucose, after treating low blood glucose until they are normoglycemic, and prior to critical tasks such as driving. (B)</s> <s i="111">

c When prescribed as part of a broader educational context, SMBG results may be helpful to guide treatment decisions and/or patient self-management for patients using less frequent insulin injections or noninsulin therapies. (E)</s> <s i="112">

c When prescribing SMBG, ensure that patients receive ongoing instruction and regular evaluation of SMBG technique and SMBG results, as well as their ability to use SMBG data to adjust therapy. (E)</s> <s i="113">

c Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in conjunction with intensive insulin regimens can be a useful tool to lower A1C in selected adults (aged >=25 years) with type 1 diabetes. (A)</s> <s i="114">

c  Although the evidence for A1C lowering is less strong in children, teens, and younger adults, CGM may be helpful in these groups. (C)</s> <s i="115">Success correlates with adherence to ongoing use of the device.</s> <s i="116">

c CGM may be a supplemental tool to SMBG in those with hypoglycemia unawareness and/or frequent hypoglycemic episodes. (E)</s> <s i="117">



A1C

c Perform the A1C test at least two times a year in patients who are meeting treatment goals (and who have stable glycemic control). (E)</s> <s i="118">

c Perform the A1C test quarterly in patients whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting glycemic goals. (E)</s> <s i="119">

c Use of point-of-care testing for A1C provides the opportunity for more timely treatment changes. (E)</s> <s i="120">



Glycemic goals in adults

c Lowering A1C to below or around 7% has been shown to reduce microvascular complications of diabetes, and if implemented soon after the diagnosis of diabetes is associated with long-term reduction in macrovascular disease. (B)</s> <s i="121">Therefore, a reasonable A1C goal for many nonpregnant adults is <7%.</s> <s i="122">

c Providers might reasonably suggest more  stringent  A1C  goals  (such  as <6.5%) for selected individual patients, if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. (C)</s> <s i="123">Appropriate patients might include those with short duration of diabetes, long life expectancy, and no significant CVD.</s> <s i="124">

c  Less  stringent  A1C  goals  (such  as <8%) may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, extensive comorbid conditions, and those with long-standing diabetes in whom the general goal is difficult to attain despite diabetes self-management education (DSME), appropriate glucose monitoring, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents including insulin. (B)</s> <s i="125">



Pharmacological and overall approaches to treatment

Insulin therapy for type 1 diabetes

c Most people with type 1 diabetes should be treated with MDI injections (three to four injections per day of basal and prandial insulin) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). (A)</s> <s i="126">

 

c Most people with type 1 diabetes should be educated in how to match prandial insulin dose to carbohydrate intake, premeal blood glucose, and anticipated activity. (E)</s> <s i="127">

c Most people with type 1 diabetes should use insulin analogs to reduce hypoglycemia risk. (A)</s> <s i="128">

c Consider screening those with type 1 diabetes for other autoimmune diseases (thyroid, vitamin B12 deficiency, celiac) as appropriate. (B)</s> <s i="129">



Pharmacological therapy for hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes

c Metformin, if not contraindicated and if tolerated, is the preferred initial pharmacological agent for type 2 diabetes. (A)</s> <s i="130">

c In newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients with markedly symptomatic and/or elevated blood glucose levels or A1C, consider insulin therapy, with or without additional agents, from the outset. (E)</s> <s i="131">

c If noninsulin monotherapy at maximal tolerated dose does not achieve or maintain the A1C target over 3–6 months, add a second oral agent, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, or insulin. (A)</s> <s i="132">

c A patient-centered approach should be used to guide choice of pharmacological agents. (E)</s> <s i="133">Considerations include efficacy, cost, potential side effects, effects on weight, comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, and patient preferences.</s> <s i="134">

c Due to the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, insulin therapy is eventually indicated for many patients with type 2 diabetes. (B)</s> <s i="135">



Medical nutrition therapy

General recommendations

c Individuals who have prediabetes or diabetes should receive individualized medical nutrition therapy (MNT) as needed to achieve treatment goals, preferably provided by a registered dietitian familiar with the components of diabetes MNT. (A)</s> <s i="136">

c Because MNT can result in cost-savings and improved outcomes (B), MNT should be adequately covered by insurance and other payers. (E)</s> <s i="137">

Energy balance, overweight, and obesity

c Weight loss is recommended for all overweight or obese individuals who have or are at risk for diabetes. (A)</s> <s i="138">

 

c For weight loss, either low-carbohydrate, low-fat calorie-restricted, or Mediterranean diets may be effective in the short term (up to 2 years). (A)</s> <s i="139">

c For patients on low-carbohydrate diets, monitor lipid profiles, renal function, and protein intake (in those with nephropathy) and adjust hypoglycemic therapy as needed. (E)</s> <s i="140">

c Physical activity and behavior modification are important components of weight loss programs  and are  most helpful in maintenance of weight loss. (B)</s> <s i="141">



Recommendations for primary prevention of type 2 diabetes

c Among individuals at high risk for developing type 2 diabetes, structured programs that emphasize lifestyle changes that include moderate weight loss (7% body weight) and regular physical activity (150 min/week), with dietary strategies including reduced calories and reduced intake of dietary fat, can reduce the risk for developing diabetes and are therefore recommended. (A)</s> <s i="142">

c Individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes should be encouraged to achieve the

U.S. (B)</s> <s i="143">Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommendation for dietary fiber (14 g fiber/1,000 kcal) and foods  containing whole grains (one-half of grain intake).</s> <s i="144">

c Individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes should be encouraged to limit their intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). (B)</s> <s i="145">



Recommendations for management of diabetes

Macronutrients in diabetes management • The mix of carbohydrate, protein, and fat may be adjusted to meet the metabolic goals and individual preferences of the person with diabetes. (C)</s> <s i="146">

c Monitoring carbohydrate, whether by carbohydrate counting, choices, or experience-based estimation, remains a key strategy in achieving glycemic control. (B)</s> <s i="147">

c Saturated fat intake should be <7% of total calories. (B)</s> <s i="148">

c Reducing intake of trans fat lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol (A); therefore, intake of trans fat should be minimized. (E)</s> <s i="149">

Other nutrition recommendations

c If adults with diabetes choose to use alcohol, they should limit intake to a moderate amount (one drink per day or less for adult women and two drinks per  day or less for  adult men) and should take extra precautions to prevent hypoglycemia. (E)</s> <s i="150">

c Routine supplementation with antioxidants, such as vitamins E and C and carotene, is not advised because of lack of evidence of efficacy and concern related to long-term safety. (A)</s> <s i="151">

c It is recommended that individualized meal planning include optimization of food choices to meet recommended dietary allowance (RDA)/dietary reference intake (DRI) for all micronutrients. (E)</s> <s i="152">



Diabetes self-management education and support

c People with diabetes should receive DSME and diabetes self-management support (DSMS) according to National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support when their diabetes is diagnosed and as needed thereafter. (B)</s> <s i="153">

c Effective self-management and quality of life are the key outcomes of DSME and DSMS and should be measured and monitored as part of care. (C)</s> <s i="154">

c DSME and DSMS should address psychosocial issues, since emotional well-being is associated with positive diabetes outcomes. (C)</s> <s i="155">

c DSME and DSMS programs are appropriate venues for people with prediabetes to receive education and support to develop and maintain behaviors that can prevent or delay the onset of diabetes. (C)</s> <s i="156">

c Because DSME and DSMS can result in cost-savings and improved outcomes (B), DSME and DSMS should be adequately reimbursed by third-party payers. (E)</s> <s i="157">



Physical activity

c Adults with diabetes should be advised to perform at least 150 min/week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity (50–70% of maximum heart rate), spread over at least 3 days/week with no more than 2 consecutive days without exercise. (A)</s> <s i="158">

c In the absence of contraindications, adults with type 2 diabetes should be encouraged to perform resistance training at least twice per week. (A)</s> <s i="159">



Psychosocial assessment and care

c It is reasonable to include assessment of the patient’s psychological and social situation as an ongoing part of the medical management of diabetes. (E)</s> <s i="160">

 

c Psychosocial screening and follow-up may include, but are not limited to, attitudes about the illness, expectations for medical management and outcomes, affect/mood, general and diabetes-related quality of life, resources (financial, social, and emotional), and psychiatric history. (E)</s> <s i="161">

c Screen for psychosocial problems such as depression and diabetes-related distress, anxiety, eating disorders, and cognitive impairment when selfmanagement is poor. (B)</s> <s i="162">



Hypoglycemia

c Individuals at risk for hypoglycemia should be asked about symptomatic and asymptomatic hypoglycemia at each encounter. (C)</s> <s i="163">

c Glucose (15–20 g) is the preferred treatment for the conscious individual with hypoglycemia, although any form of carbohydrate that contains glucose may be used. (E)</s> <s i="164">If SMBG 15 min after treatment shows continued hypoglycemia, the treatment should be repeated.</s> <s i="165">Once SMBG glucose returns to normal, the individual should consume a meal or snack to prevent recurrence of hypoglycemia.</s> <s i="166">

c Glucagon should be prescribed for all individuals at significant risk of severe hypoglycemia, and caregivers or family members of these individuals should be instructed on its administration. (E)</s> <s i="167">Glucagon administration is not limited to health care professionals.</s> <s i="168">

c Hypoglycemia unawareness or one or more episodes of severe hypoglycemia should trigger re-evaluation of the treatment regimen. (E)</s> <s i="169">

c Insulin-treated patients with hypoglycemia unawareness or an episode of severe hypoglycemia should be advised to raise their glycemic targets to strictly avoid further hypoglycemia for at least several weeks, to partially reverse hypoglycemia unawareness, and to reduce risk of future episodes. (A)</s> <s i="170">

c Ongoing assessment of cognitive function is suggested with increased vigilance for hypoglycemia by the clinician, patient, and caregivers if low cognition and/or declining cognition is found. (B)</s> <s i="171">



Bariatric surgery

c Bariatric surgery may be considered for adults with BMI >=35 kg/m2 and type 2 diabetes, especially if the diabetes or associated comorbidities are difficult to control with lifestyle and pharmacological therapy. (B)</s> <s i="172">

c Patients with type 2 diabetes who have undergone bariatric surgery need lifelong lifestyle support and medical monitoring. (B)</s> <s i="173">

c Although small trials have shown glycemic benefit of bariatric surgery in patients with type 2 diabetes and BMI 30–35 kg/m2, there is currently insufficient evidence to generally recommend surgery in patients with BMI <35 kg/m2 outside of a research protocol. (E)</s> <s i="174">

c The long-term benefits, cost-effectiveness, and risks of bariatric surgery in individuals with type 2 diabetes should be studied in well-designed controlled trials with optimal medical and lifestyle therapy as the comparator. (E)</s> <s i="175">



Immunization

c Annually provide an influenza vaccine to all diabetic patients >=6 months of age. (C)</s> <s i="176">

c Administer pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine to all diabetic patients >=2 years of age.

Goals

c People with diabetes and hypertension should be treated to a systolic blood pressure goal of <140 mmHg. (B)</s> <s i="184">

c Lower systolic targets, such as <130 mmHg, may be appropriate for certain individuals, such as younger patients, if it can be achieved without undue treatment burden. (C)</s> <s i="185">

c Patients with diabetes should be treated to a diastolic blood pressure <80 mmHg. (B)</s> <s i="186">

Treatment

c Patients with a blood pressure >120/80 mmHg should be advised on lifestyle changes to reduce blood pressure. (B)</s> <s i="187">

c  Patients with confirmed blood pressure >=140/80 mmHg should, in addition to lifestyle therapy, have prompt initiation and timely subsequent titration of pharmacological therapy to achieve blood pressure goals. (B)</s> <s i="188">

Treatment recommendations and goals

c Lifestyle modification focusing on the reduction of saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol intake; increase of n-3 fatty acids, viscous fiber and plant stanols/ sterols; weight loss (if indicated); and increased physical activity should be recommended to improve the lipid profile in patients with diabetes. (A)</s> <s i="199">

c Statin therapy should be added to lifestyle therapy, regardless of baseline lipid levels, for diabetic patients:

c  with overt CVD (A)

c without CVD who are over the age of 40 years and have one or more other CVD risk factors (family history of CVD, hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, or albuminuria). (A)</s> <s i="200">

<s i="371">Epidemiological datasets show a similar relationship for A1C to the risk of retinopathy as has been shown for the corresponding FPG and 2-h PG thresholds.</s> <s i="372">The A1C has several advantages to the FPG and OGTT, including greater convenience (since fasting is not required), evidence to suggest greater preanalytical stability, and less day-to-day perturbations during periods of stress and illness.</s> <s i="373">These advantages must be balanced by greater cost, the limited availability of A1C testing in certain regions of the developing world, and the incomplete correlation between A1C and average glucose in certain individuals.</s> <s i="374">In addition, HbA1c levels may vary with patients’ race/ethnicity (7,8).</s> <s i="375">Some have posited that glycation rates differ by race (with, for example, African Americans having higher rates of glycation), but this is controversial.</s> <s i="376">A recent epidemiological study found that, when matched for FPG, African Americans (with and without diabetes) indeed had higher A1C than whites, but also had higher levels of fructosamine and glycated albumin and lower levels of 1,5 anhydroglucitol, suggesting that their glycemic burden (particularly postprandially) may be higher (9).</s> <s i="377">Epidemiological studies forming the framework for recommending use of the A1C to diagnose diabetes have all been in adult populations.</s> <s i="378">Whether the cut point would be the same to diagnose children or adolescents with type 2 diabetes is an area of uncertainty (3,10).</s> <s i="379">A1C inaccurately reflects glycemia with certain anemias and hemoglobinopathies.</s> <s i="380">For patients with an abnormal hemoglobin but normal red cell turnover, such as sickle cell trait, an A1C assay without interference from abnormal hemoglobins should be used (an updated list is available at www. ngsp.org/interf.asp).</s> <s i="381">For conditions with abnormal red cell turnover, such as pregnancy, recent blood loss or transfusion, or some anemias, the diagnosis of diabetes must employ glucose criteria exclusively.</s>
<s i="382">The established glucose criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes (FPG and 2-h PG) remain valid as well (Table 2).</s> <s i="383">Just as there is less than 100% concordance between the FPG and 2-h PG tests, there is no perfect concordance between A1C and either glucose-based test.</s> <s i="384">Analyses of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data indicate that, assuming universal screening of the undiagnosed, the A1C cut point of >=6.5% identifies one-third fewer cases of undiagnosed diabetes than a fasting glucose cut point of >=126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) (11), and numerous studies have confirmed that at these cut points the 2-h OGTT value diagnoses more screened people with diabetes (12).</s> <s i="385">However, in practice, a large portion of the diabetic population remains unaware of its condition.</s> <s i="386">Thus, the lower sensitivity of A1C at the designated cut point may well be offset by the test’s greater practicality, and wider application of a more convenient test (A1C) may actually increase the number of diagnoses made.</s>

<s i="387">As with most diagnostic tests, a test result diagnostic of diabetes should be repeated to rule out laboratory error, unless the diagnosis is clear on clinical grounds, such as a patient with a hyperglycemic crisis or classic symptoms of hyperglycemia and a random plasma glucose >=200 mg/dL.</s> <s i="388">It is preferable that the same test be repeated for confirmation, since there will be a greater likelihood of concurrence in this case.</s> <s i="389">For example, if the A1C is 7.0% and a repeat result is 6.8%, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed.</s> <s i="390">However, if two different tests (such as A1C and FPG) are both above the diagnostic thresholds, the diagnosis of diabetes is also confirmed.</s>

<s i="391">On the other hand, if two different tests are available in an individual and the results are discordant, the test whose result is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, and the diagnosis is made based on the confirmed test.</s> <s i="392">That is, if a patient meets the diabetes criterion of the A1C (two results >=6.5%) but not the FPG (<126 mg/ dL or 7.0 mmol/L), or vice versa, that person should be considered to have diabetes.</s> <s i="393">Since there is preanalytical and analytical variability of all the tests, it is also possible that when a test whose result was above the diagnostic threshold is  repeated, the second value will be below the diagnostic cut point.</s> <s i="394">This is least likely for A1C, somewhat more likely for FPG, and most likely for the 2-h PG.</s> <s i="395">Barring a laboratory error, such patients are likely to have test results near the margins of the threshold for a diagnosis.</s> <s i="396">The health care professional might opt to follow the patient closely and repeat the testing in 3–6 months.</s>

In 1997 and 2003, the Expert Committee on Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus (13,14) recognized an intermediate group of individuals whose glucose levels, although not meeting criteria for diabetes, are nevertheless too high to be considered normal.</s> <s i="400">These persons were defined as having impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG levels 100 mg/dL [5.6 mmol/L] to 125 mg/dL [6.9 mmol/L]) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (2-h values in the OGTT of 140 mg/dL [7.8 mmol/L] to 199 mg/dL [11.0 mmol/L]).</s> <s i="401">It should be noted that the World Health Organization (WHO) and a number of other diabetes organizations define the cutoff for IFG at 110 mg/dL (6.1 mmol/L).</s>

<s i="402">Individuals with IFG and/or IGT have been referred to as having prediabetes, indicating the relatively high risk for the future development of diabetes.</s> <s i="403">IFG and IGT should not be viewed as clinical entities in their own right but rather risk factors for diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD).</s> <s i="404">IFG and IGT are associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension.</s>

<s i="405">As is the case with the glucose measures, several prospective studies that used A1C to predict the progression to diabetes demonstrated a strong, continuous association between A1C and subsequent diabetes.</s> <s i="406">In a systematic review of 44,203 individuals from 16 cohort studies with a follow-up interval averaging 5.6 years (range 2.8–12 years), those with an A1C between 5.5 and 6.0% had a substantially increased risk of diabetes with 5-year incidences ranging from 9 to 25%.</s> <s i="407">An A1C range of 6.0–6.5% had a 5-year risk of developing diabetes between 25 to 50% and relative risk (RR) 20 times higher compared with an A1C of 5.0% (15).</s> <s i="408">In a communitybased study of black and white adults without diabetes, baseline A1C was a stronger predictor of subsequent diabetes and cardiovascular events than was fasting glucose (16).</s> <s i="409">Other analyses suggest that an A1C of 5.7% is associated with diabetes risk similar to that in the highrisk participants in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) (17).</s>

<s i="432">A.</s>	<s i="433">Testing for type 2 diabetes and risk of future diabetes in adults

Prediabetes and diabetes meet established criteria for conditions in which early detection is appropriate.</s> <s i="434">Both conditions are common, increasing in prevalence, and impose significant public health burdens.</s> <s i="435">There is a long presymptomatic phase before the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes is usually made.</s> <s i="436">Relatively simple tests are available to detect preclinical disease.</s> <s i="437">Additionally, the duration of glycemic burden is a strong predictor of adverse outcomes, and effective interventions exist to prevent progression of prediabetes to diabetes (see Section IV) and to reduce risk of complications of diabetes (see Section VI).</s>

<s i="438">Type 2 diabetes is frequently not diagnosed until complications appear, and approximately one-fourth of all people with diabetes in the U.S. may be undiagnosed.</s> <s i="439">The effectiveness of early identification of prediabetes and diabetes through mass testing of asymptomatic individuals has not been proven definitively, and rigorous trials to provide such proof are unlikely to occur.</s> <s i="440">In a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Europe, general practice patients between the ages of 40– 69 years were screened for diabetes and then randomly assigned by practice to routine care of diabetes or intensive treatment of multiple risk factors.</s> <s i="441">After 5.3 years of follow-up, CVD risk factors were modestly but significantly more improved with intensive treatment.</s> <s i="442">Incidence of first CVD event and mortality rates were not significantly different between groups (18).</s> <s i="443">This study would seem to add support for early treatment of screen-detected diabetes, as risk factor control was excellent even in the routine treatment arm and both groups had lower event rates than predicted.</s> <s i="444">The absence of a control unscreened arm limits the ability to definitely prove that screening impacts outcomes.</s> <s i="445">Mathematical modeling studies suggest that screening independent of risk factors beginning at age 30 years or age 45 years is highly cost-effective (,$11,000 per quality-adjusted lifeyear gained) (19).</s>

<s i="446">Recommendations for testing for diabetes in asymptomatic, undiagnosed adults are listed in Table 4.</s> <s i="447">Testing should be considered in adults of any age with BMI >=25 kg/m2 and one or more of the known risk factors for diabetes.</s> <s i="448">In addition to the listed risk factors, certain medications, such as glucocorticoids and antipsychotics (20), are known to increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.</s> <s i="449">There is compelling evidence that lower BMI cut points suggest diabetes risk in some racial and ethnic groups.</s> <s i="450">In a large multiethnic cohort study, for an equivalent incidence rate of diabetes conferred by a BMI of 30 kg/m2 in whites, the BMI cutoff value was 24 kg/m2 in South Asians, 25 kg/m2 in Chinese, and 26 kg/m2 in African Americans (21).</s> <s i="451">Disparities in screening rates, not explainable by insurance status, are highlighted by evidence that despite much higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes, non-Caucasians in an insured population are no more likely than Caucasians to be screened for diabetes (22).</s> <s i="452">Because age isa major risk factor for diabetes, testing of those without other risk factors should begin no later than age 45 years.</s>

<s i="453">The A1C, FPG, or the 2-h OGTT are appropriate for testing.</s> <s i="454">It should be noted that the tests do not necessarily detect diabetes in the same individuals.</s> <s i="455">The efficacy of interventions for primary prevention of type 2 diabetes (23–29) has primarily been demonstrated among individuals with IGT, not for individuals with isolated IFG or for individuals with specific A1C levels.</s>

<s i="456">The appropriate  interval  between tests is not known (30).</s> <s i="457">The rationale for the 3-year interval is that false negatives will be repeated before substantial time elapses, and there is little likelihood that an individual will develop significant complications of diabetes within 3 years of a negative test result.</s> <s i="458">In the modeling study, repeat screening every 3 or 5 years was cost-effective (19).</s>

<s i="459">Because of the need for follow-up and discussion of abnormal results, testing should be carried out within the health care setting.</s> <s i="460">Community screening outside a health care setting is not recommended because people with positive tests may not seek, or have access to, appropriate follow-up testing and care.</s> <s i="461">Conversely, there may be failure to ensure appropriate repeat testing for individuals who test negative.</s> <s i="462">Community screening may also be poorly targeted; i. e., it may fail to reach the groups most at risk and inappropriately test those at low risk (the worried well) or even those already diagnosed.</s>

Major clinical trials of insulin-treated patients that demonstrated the benefits of intensive glycemic control on diabetes complications have included SMBG as part of multifactorial interventions, suggesting that SMBG is a component of effective therapy.</s> <s i="571">SMBG allows patients to evaluate their individual response to therapy and assess whether glycemic targets are being achieved.</s> <s i="572">Results of SMBG can be useful in preventing hypoglycemia and adjusting medications (particularly prandial insulin doses), medical nutrition therapy (MNT), and physical activity.</s>

<s i="573">The frequency and timing of SMBG should be dictated by the particular needs and goals of the patient.</s> <s i="574">SMBG is especially important for patients treated with insulin to monitor for and prevent asymptomatic hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.</s> <s i="575">Most patients with type 1 diabetes and others on intensive insulin regimens (MDI or insulin pump therapy) should do SMBG at least prior to meals and snacks, occasionally postprandially, at bedtime, prior to exercise, when they suspect low blood glucose, after treating low blood glucose until they are normoglycemic, and prior to critical tasks such as driving.</s> <s i="576">For many patients, this will require testing 6–8 times daily, although individual needs may be greater.</s> <s i="577">Although there are few rigorous studies, a database study of almost 27,000 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes showed that, after adjustment for multiple confounders, increased daily frequency of SMBG was significantly associated with lower A1C (20.2% per additional test per day, leveling off at five tests per day) and with fewer acute complications (57).</s> <s i="578">The optimal frequency of SMBG for patients on nonintensive regimens, such as those with type 2 diabetes on basal insulin, is not known, although a number of studies have used fasting SMBG for patient or provider titration of the basal insulin dose.</s>

<s i="579">The evidence base for SMBG for patients with type 2 diabetes on noninsulin therapy is somewhat mixed.</s> <s i="580">Several randomized trials have called into question the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of routine SMBG in non–insulin-treated patients (58–60).</s> <s i="581">A recent meta-analysis suggested that SMBG reduced A1C by 0.25% at 6 months (61), while a Cochrane review concluded that the overall effect of SMBG in such patients is small up to 6 months after initiation and subsides after 12 months (62).</s>

<s i="582">Because the accuracy of SMBG is instrument and user dependent (63), it is important to evaluate each patient’s monitoring technique, both initially and at regular intervals thereafter.</s> <s i="583">Optimal use of SMBG requires proper review and interpretation of the data, both by the patient and provider.</s> <s i="584">Among patients who checked their blood glucose at least once daily, many reported taking no action when results were high or low (64).</s> <s i="585">In one study of insulin-naïve patients with suboptimal initial glycemic control, use of structured SMBG (a paper tool to collect and interpret 7-point SMBG profiles over 3 days at least quarterly) reduced A1C by 0.3% more than in an active control group (65).</s> <s i="586">Patients should be taught how to use SMBG data to adjust food intake, exercise, or pharmacological therapy to achieve specific goals, and the ongoing need for and frequency of SMBG should be re-evaluated at each routine visit.</s>

<s i="587">Real-time CGM through the measurement of interstitial glucose (which correlates well with plasma glucose) is available.</s> <s i="588">These sensors require calibration with SMBG, and the latter are still recommended for making acute treatment decisions.</s> <s i="589">CGM devices have alarms for hypoand hyperglycemic excursions.</s> <s i="590">A 26-week randomized trial of 322 type 1 diabetic patients showed that adults aged >=25 years using intensive insulin therapy and CGM experienced a 0.5% reduction in A1C (from ~7.6 to 7.1%) compared with usual intensive insulin therapy with SMBG (66).</s> <s i="591">Sensor use in children, teens, and adults to age 24 years did not result in significant A1C lowering, and there was no significant difference in hypoglycemia in any group.</s> <s i="592">Importantly, the greatest predictor of A1C lowering in this study for all age-groups was frequency of sensor use, which was lower in younger age-groups.</s> <s i="593">In a smaller RCT of 129 adults and children with baseline A1C <7.0%, outcomes combining A1C and hypoglycemia favored the group utilizing CGM, suggesting that CGM is also beneficial for individuals with type 1 diabetes who have already achieved excellent control (67).</s>

<s i="594">A trial comparing CGM plus insulin pump to SMBG plus multiple injections of insulin in adults and children with type

1 diabetes showed significantly greater improvements in A1C with “sensoraugmented pump” therapy (68,69), but this trial did not isolate the effect of CGM itself.</s> <s i="595">Overall, meta-analyses suggest that compared with SMBG, CGM lowers A1C by ~0.26% (70).</s> <s i="596">Altogether, these data suggest that, in appropriately selected patients who are motivated to wear it most of the time, CGM reduces A1C.</s> <s i="597">The technology may be particularly useful in those with hypoglycemia unawareness and/or frequent episodes of hypoglycemia, although studies as yet have not shown significant reductions in severe hypoglycemia (70).</s> <s i="598">CGM forms the underpinning for the development of pumps that suspend insulin delivery when hypoglycemia is developing and for the burgeoning work on “artificial pancreas” systems.

<s i="608">The A1C test is subject to certain limitations.</s> <s i="609">Conditions that affect erythrocyte turnover (hemolysis, blood loss) and hemoglobin variants must be considered, particularly when the A1C result does not correlate with the patient’s clinical situation (63).</s> <s i="610">In addition, A1C does not provide a measure of glycemic variability or hypoglycemia.</s> <s i="611">For patients prone to glycemic variability (especially type 1 diabetic patients or type 2 diabetic patients with severe insulin deficiency), glycemic control is best judged by the combination of results of self-monitoring and the A1C.</s> <s i="612">The A1C may also serve as a check on the accuracy of the patient’s meter (or the patient’s reported SMBG results) and the adequacy of the SMBG testing schedule.</s>

c   Less  stringent  A1C  goals  (such  as <8%) may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, extensive comorbid conditions, and those with long-standing diabetes in whom the general goal is difficult to attain despite DSME, appropriate glucose monitoring, and effective doses of multiple glucose-lowering agents including insulin. (B)</s> <s i="632">

Hyperglycemia defines diabetes, and glycemic control is fundamental to the management of diabetes.</s> <s i="633">The DCCT (71), a prospective RCT of intensive versus standard glycemic control in patients with relatively recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes, showed definitively that improved glycemic control is associated with significantly decreased rates of
 

microvascular (retinopathy and nephropathy) and neuropathic complications.</s> <s i="634">Follow-up of the DCCT cohorts in the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study (80,81) demonstrated persistence of these microvascular benefits in previously intensively treated subjects, even though their glycemic control approximated that of previous standard arm subjects during follow-up.</s>

<s i="635">The Kumamoto Study (82) and UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) (83,84) confirmed that intensive glycemic control was associated with significantly decreased rates of microvascular and neuropathic complications in patients with type 2 diabetes.</s> <s i="636">Long-term follow-up of the UKPDS cohorts showed persistence of the effect of early glycemic control on most microvascular complications (85).</s>

<s i="637">Subsequent trials in patients with more long-standing type 2 diabetes, designed primarily to look at the role of intensive glycemic control on cardiovascular outcomes, also confirmed a benefit, although more modest, on onset or progression of microvascular complications.</s> <s i="638">The Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT) showed significant reductions in albuminuria with intensive (achieved median A1C 6.9%) compared with standard glycemic control, but no difference in retinopathy and neuropathy (86,87).</s> <s i="639">The Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) study of intensive versus standard glycemic control in type 2 diabetes found a statistically significant reduction in albuminuria, but not in neuropathy or retinopathy, with an A1C target of ,6.5% (achieved median A1C 6.3%) compared with standard therapy achieving a median A1C of 7.0% (88).</s> <s i="640">Analyses from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial have shown lower rates of onset or progression of early-stage microvascular complications in the intensive glycemic control arm compared with the standard arm (89,90).</s>


<s i="641">Epidemiological analyses of the DCCT and UKPDS (71,72) demonstrate a curvi-linear relationship between A1C and microvascular complications.</s> <s i="642">Such analyses suggest that, on a population level, the greatest number of complications will be averted by taking patients from very poor control to fair or good control.</s> <s i="643">These analyses also suggest that further lowering of A1C from 7 to 6% is associated with further reduction in the risk of microvascular complications, albeit the absolute risk reductions become much smaller.</s> <s i="644">Given the substantially increased risk of hypoglycemia (particularly in those with type 1 diabetes, but also in the recent type 2 diabetes trials), the concerning mortality findings in the ACCORD trial (91), and the relatively much greater effort required to achieve near-normoglycemia, the risks of lower glycemic targets may outweigh the potential benefits on microvascular complications on a population level.</s> <s i="645">However, selected individual patients, especially those with little comorbidity and long life expectancy (who may reap the benefits of further lowering of glycemia below 7%), may, based on provider judgment and patient preferences, adopt more intensive glycemic targets (e.g., an A1C target <6.5%) as long as significant hypoglycemia does not become a barrier.</s>

<s i="646">CVD, a more common cause of death in populations with diabetes than microvascular complications, is less clearly impacted by levels of hyperglycemia or the intensity of glycemic control.</s> <s i="647">In the DCCT, there was a trend toward lower risk of CVD events with intensive control, and in 9-year post-DCCT follow-up of the EDIC cohort participants previously randomized to the intensive arm had a significant 57% reduction in the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or CVD death compared with those previously in the standard arm (92).</s> <s i="648">The benefit of intensive glycemic control in this type 1 diabetic cohort has recently been shown to persist for several decades (93).</s>

<s i="649">In type 2 diabetes, there is evidence that more intensive treatment of glycemia in newly diagnosed patients may reduce long-term CVD rates.</s> <s i="650">During the UKPDS trial, there was a 16% reduction in cardiovascular events (combined fatal or nonfatal MI and sudden death) in the intensive glycemic control arm that did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.052), and there was no suggestion of benefit on other CVD outcomes such as stroke.</s> <s i="651">However, after 10 years of followup, those originally randomized to intensive glycemic control had significant long-term reductions in MI (15% with sulfonylurea or insulin as initial pharmacotherapy, 33% with metformin as initial pharmacotherapy) and in all-cause mortality (13% and 27%, respectively) (85).</s>

<s i="652">Three more recent large trials (ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VADT) suggested no significant reduction in CVD outcomes with intensive glycemic control in participants who had more advanced type 2 diabetes than UKPDS participants.</s>

 

<s i="653">All three of these trials were conducted in participants with more long-standing diabetes (mean duration 8–11 years) and either known CVD or multiple cardiovascular risk factors.</s> <s i="654">Details of these three studies are reviewed extensively in an ADA position statement (94).</s>

<s i="655">The ACCORD study enrolled participants with either known CVD or two or more major cardiovascular risk factors and randomized them to intensive glycemic control (goal A1C <6%) or standard glycemic control (goal A1C 7–8%).</s> <s i="656">The glycemic control comparison was halted early due to the finding of an increased rate of mortality in the intensive arm compared with the standard arm (1.41% vs. 1.14% per year; HR 1.22; 95% CI 1.01–1.46), with a similar increase in cardiovascular deaths.</s> <s i="657">This increase in mortality in the intensive glycemic control arm was seen in all prespecified patient subgroups.</s> <s i="658">The primary outcome of ACCORD (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death) was nonsignificantly lower in the intensive glycemic control group due to a reduction in nonfatal MI, both when the glycemic control comparison was halted and all participants transitioned to the standard glycemic control intervention (91), and at completion of the planned follow-up (95).</s>

<s i="659">Exploratory analyses of the mortality findings of ACCORD (evaluating variables including weight gain, use of any specific drug or drug combination, and hypoglycemia) were reportedly unable to identify a clear explanation for the excess mortality in the intensive arm (91).</s> <s i="660">The ACCORD investigators subsequently published additional epidemiological analyses showing no increase in mortality in the intensive arm participants who achieved A1C levels below 7% nor in those who lowered their A1C quickly after trial enrollment.</s> <s i="661">In fact, although there was no A1C level at which intensive arm participants had significantly lower mortality than standard arm participants, the highest risk for mortality was observed in intensive arm participants with the highest A1C levels (96).</s>

<s i="662">The role of hypoglycemia in the excess mortality findings was also complex.</s> <s i="663">Severe hypoglycemia was significantly more likely in participants randomized to the intensive glycemic control arm.</s> <s i="664">However, excess mortality in the intensive versus standard arms was only significant for participants with no severe hypoglycemia, and not for those with one or more episodes.</s> <s i="665">Severe hypoglycemia was associated with excess mortality in either arm, but the association was stronger in those randomized to the standard glycemic control arm (97).</s> <s i="666">Unlike the case with the DCCT trial, where lower achieved A1C levels were related to significantly increased rates of severe hypoglycemia, in ACCORD every 1% decline in A1C from baseline to 4 months into the trial was associated with a significant decrease in the rate of severe hypoglycemia in both arms (96).</s>

<s i="829">Progressive resistance exercise improves insulin sensitivity in older men with type 2 diabetes to the same or even a greater extent as aerobic exercise (191).</s> <s i="830">Clinical trials have provided strong evidence for the A1C lowering value of resistance training in older adults with type 2 diabetes (192,193) and for an additive benefit of combined aerobic and resistance exercise in adults with type 2 diabetes (194,195).</s> <s i="831">In the absence of contraindications, patients with type 2 diabetes should be encouraged to do at least two weekly sessions of resistance exercise (exercise with free weights or weight machines), with each session consisting of at least one set of five or more different resistance exercises involving the large muscle groups (189).</s>

<s i="832">Evaluation of the diabetic patient before recommending an exercise program

Prior guidelines suggested that before recommending a program of physical activity, the provider should assess patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD).</s> <s i="833">As discussed more fully in Section VI.A.5, the area of screening asymptomatic diabetic patients for CAD remains unclear, and a recent ADA consensus statement on this issue concluded that routine screening is not recommended (196).</s> <s i="834">Providers should use clinical judgment in this area.</s> <s i="835">Certainly, high-risk patients should be encouraged to start with short periods of low-intensity exercise and increase the intensity and duration slowly.</s>

<s i="836">Providers should assess patients for conditions that might contraindicate certain types of exercise or predispose to injury, such as uncontrolled hypertension, severe autonomic neuropathy, severe peripheral neuropathy or history of foot lesions, and unstable proliferative retinopathy.</s> <s i="837">The patient’s age and previous physical activity level should be considered.</s>



<s i="838">Exercise in the presence of nonoptimal glycemic control

Hyperglycemia.</s> <s i="839">When people with type 1 diabetes are deprived of insulin for 12– 48 h and are ketotic, exercise can worsen hyperglycemia and ketosis (197); therefore, vigorous activity should be avoided in the presence of ketosis.</s> <s i="840">However, it is not necessary to postpone exercise based simply on hyperglycemia, provided the patient feels well and urine and/or blood ketones are negative.</s>

<s i="841">Hypoglycemia.</s> <s i="842">In individuals taking insulin and/or insulin secretagogues, physical activity can cause hypoglycemia if medication dose or carbohydrate consumption is not altered.</s> <s i="843">For individuals on these therapies, added carbohydrate should be ingested if pre-exercise glucose levels are <100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L).</s> <s i="844">Hypoglycemia is rare in diabetic individuals who are not treated with insulin or insulin secretagogues, and no preventive measures for hypoglycemia are usually advised in these cases.</s>

<s i="847">Peripheral neuropathy.</s> <s i="848">Decreased pain sensation in the extremities results in increased risk of skin breakdown and infection and of Charcot joint destruction.</s> <s i="849">Prior recommendations have advised non–weight-bearing exercise for patients with severe peripheral neuropathy.</s> <s i="850">However, studies have shown that moderate-intensity walking may not lead to increased risk of foot ulcers or reulceration in those with peripheral neuropathy (199).</s> <s i="851">All individuals with peripheral neuropathy should wear proper footwear and examine their feet daily to detect lesions early.</s> <s i="852">Anyone with a foot injury or open sore should be restricted to non–weight-bearing activities.</s>

<s i="853">Autonomic neuropathy.</s> <s i="854">Autonomic neuropathy can increase the risk of exerciseinduced injury or adverse event through decreased cardiac responsiveness to exercise, postural hypotension, impaired thermoregulation, impaired night vision due to impaired papillary reaction, and unpredictable carbohydrate delivery from gastroparesis predisposing to hypoglycemia (200).</s> <s i="855">Autonomic neuropathy is also strongly associated with CVD in people with diabetes (201,202).</s> <s i="856">People with diabetic autonomic neuropathy should undergo cardiac investigation before beginning physical activity more intense than that to which they are accustomed.</s>

<s i="857">Albuminuria and nephropathy.</s> <s i="858">Physical activity can acutely increase urinary protein excretion.</s> <s i="859">However, there is no evidence that vigorous exercise increases the rate of progression of diabetic kidney disease, and there is likely no need for any specific exercise restrictions for people with diabetic kidney disease (203).</s>

c Ongoing assessment of cognitive function is suggested with increased vigilance for hypoglycemia by the clinician, patient, and caregivers if low cognition and/or declining cognition is found. (B)</s> <s i="903">



Hypoglycemia is the leading limiting factor in the glycemic management of type 1 and insulin-treated type 2 diabetes (223).</s> <s i="904">Mild hypoglycemia may be inconvenient or frightening to patients with diabetes, and more severe hypoglycemia can cause acute harm to the person with diabetes or others, if it causes falls, motor vehicle accidents, or other injury.</s> <s i="905">A large cohort study suggested that among older adults with type 2 diabetes, a history of severe hypoglycemia was associated with greater risk of dementia (224).</s> <s i="906">Conversely, in a substudy of the ACCORD trial, cognitive impairment at baseline or decline in cognitive function during the trial was significantly associated with subsequent episodes of severe hypoglycemia (225).</s> <s i="907">Evidence from the DCCT/EDIC trial, which involved younger adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, suggested no association of frequency of severe hypoglycemia with cognitive decline (226).</s> <s i="908">As discussed in the Section VIII.A.1.a, a few studies have suggested that severe hypoglycemia in very young children is associated with mild impairments in cognitive function.</s>

<s i="909">As described in the Section V.b.2, severe hypoglycemia was associated with mortality in participants in both the standard and intensive glycemia arms of the ACCORD trial, but the relationships with achieved A1C and treatment intensity were not straightforward.</s> <s i="910">An association of severe hypoglycemia with mortality was also found in the ADVANCE trial (227), but its association with other outcomes such as pulmonary and skin disorders raises the question of whether severe hypoglycemia is a marker for a sicker patient, rather than a cause of mortality.</s> <s i="911">An association of self-reported severe hypoglycemia with 5-year mortality has also been reported in clinical practice (228).</s> <s i="912">At the time this statement went to press, the ADA and The Endocrine Society were finalizing a Hypoglycemia Work Group report, where the causes of and associations with hypoglycemia are discussed in depth.</s>

<s i="913">Treatment of hypoglycemia (plasma glucose <70 mg/dL) requires ingestion of glucoseor carbohydrate-containing foods.</s> <s i="914">The acute glycemic response correlates better with the glucose content than with the carbohydrate content of the food.</s> <s i="915">Although pure glucose is the preferred treatment, any form of carbohydrate that contains glucose will raise blood glucose.</s> <s i="916">Added fat may retard and then prolong the acute glycemic response.</s> <s i="917">Ongoing activity of insulin or insulin secretagogues may lead to recurrence of hypoglycemia unless further food is ingested after recovery.</s>

<s i="918">Severe hypoglycemia (where the individual requires the assistance of another person and cannot be treated with oral carbohydrate due to confusion or unconsciousness) should be treated using emergency glucagon kits, which require a prescription.</s> <s i="919">Those in close contact with, or having custodial care of, people with hypoglycemia-prone diabetes (family members, roommates, school personnel, child care providers, correctional institution staff, or coworkers) should be instructed in use of such kits.</s> <s i="920">An individual does not need to be a health care professional to safely administer glucagon.</s> <s i="921">Care should be taken to ensure that unexpired glucagon kits are available.</s>

<s i="922">Prevention of hypoglycemia is a critical component of diabetes management.</s> <s i="923">Particularly for insulin-treated patients, SMBG and, for some patients, CGM to detect incipient hypoglycemia and assess adequacy of treatment are a key component of safe therapy.</s> <s i="924">Patients should understand situations that increase their risk of hypoglycemia, such as when fasting for tests or procedures, during or after intense exercise, and during sleep and that increase the risk of harm to self or others from hypoglycemia, such as with driving.</s> <s i="925">Teaching people with diabetes to balance insulin use, carbohydrate intake, and exercise is a necessary but not always sufficient strategy for prevention.</s> <s i="926">In type 1 diabetes and severely insulin-deficient type 2 diabetes, the syndrome of hypoglycemia unawareness, or hypoglycemiaassociated autonomic failure, can severely compromise stringent diabetes control and quality of life.</s> <s i="927">The deficient counterregulatory hormone release and autonomic responses in this syndrome are both risk factors for, and caused by, hypoglycemia.</s> <s i="928">A corollary to this “vicious cycle” is that several weeks of avoidance of hypoglycemia has been demonstrated to improve counter-regulation and awareness to some extent in many patients (229).</s> <s i="929">Hence, patients with one or more episodes of severe hypoglycemia may benefit from at least short-term relaxation of glycemic targets.</s>

<s i="1015">The ACCORD trial examined whether blood pressure lowering to systolic blood pressure <120 mmHg provides greater cardiovascular protection than a systolic blood pressure level of 130–140 mmHg in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for CVD (258).</s> <s i="1016">The blood pressure achieved in the intensive group was 119/64 mmHg and in the standard group 133/70 mmHg; the goals were attained with an average of 3.4 medications per participant in the intensive group and 2.1 in the standard therapy group.</s> <s i="1017">The hazard ratio for the primary end point (nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, and CVD death) in the intensive group was 0.88 (95% CI 0.73–1.06, P 5 0.20).</s> <s i="1018">Of the prespecified secondary end points, only stroke and nonfatal stroke were statistically significantly reduced by intensive blood pressure treatment, with a hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% CI 0.39–0.89, P 5 0.01) and 0.63 (95% CI 0.41–0.96, P 5 0.03), respectively.</s> <s i="1019">Absolute stroke event rates were low; the number needed to treat to prevent one stroke over the course of 5 years with intensive blood pressure management is 89.</s> <s i="1020">Serious adverse event rates (including syncope and hyperkalemia) were higher with intensive targets (3.3% vs. 1.3%, P 5 0.001).</s> <s i="1021">Rates of albuminuria were reduced with more intensive blood pressure goals, but there were no differences in renal function in this 5-year trial (and in fact more adverse events related to reduced eGFR with more intensive goals) nor in other microvascular complications.</s>

<s i="1022">Other recent randomized trial data include those of the ADVANCE trial in which treatment with an ACE inhibitor and a thiazide-type diuretic reduced the rate of death but not the composite macrovascular outcome.</s> <s i="1023">However, the ADVANCE trial had no specified targets for the randomized comparison, and the mean systolic blood pressure in the intensive group (135 mmHg) was not as low as the mean systolic blood pressure even in the ACCORD standard-therapy group (259).</s> <s i="1024">Post hoc analysis of achieved blood pressure in several hypertension treatment trials has suggested no benefit of lower achieved systolic blood pressure.</s> <s i="1025">As an example, among 6,400 patients with diabetes and CAD enrolled in one trial, “tight control” (achieved systolic blood pressure <130 mmHg) was not associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes compared with “usual care” (achieved systolic blood pressure 130–140 mmHg) (260).</s> <s i="1026">Similar finding emerged from an analysis of another trial, but additionally those with achieved systolic blood pressure (<115 mmHg) had increased rates of CVD events (though lower rates of stroke) (261).</s>

<s i="1027">Observational data, including those derived from clinical trials, may be inappropriate to use for defining blood pressure targets since sicker patients may have low blood pressure or, conversely, healthier or more adherent patients may achieve goals more readily.</s> <s i="1028">A recent meta-analysis of randomized trials of adults with type 2 diabetes comparing prespecified blood pressure targets found no significant reduction in mortality or nonfatal MI.</s> <s i="1029">There was a statistically significant 35% relative reduction in stroke, but the absolute risk reduction was only 1% (262).</s> <s i="1030">Other outcomes, such as indicators of microvascular complications, were not examined.</s> <s i="1031">Another meta-analysis that included both trials comparing blood pressure goals and trials comparing treatment strategies concluded that a systolic treatment goal of 130–135 mmHg was acceptable.</s> <s i="1032">With goals <130 mmHg, there were greater reductions in stroke, a 10% reduction in mortality, but no reduction of other CVD events and increased rates of serious adverse events.</s> <s i="1033">Systolic blood pressure <130 mmHg was associated with reduced onset and progression of albuminuria.</s> <s i="1034">However, there was heterogeneity in the measure, rates of more advanced renal disease outcomes were not affected, and there were no significant changes in retinopathy or neuropathy (263).</s>

<s i="1035">This change in the “default” systolic blood pressure target is not meant to downplay the importance of treating hypertension in patients with diabetes or to imply that lower targets than <140 mmHg are generally inappropriate.</s> <s i="1036">The clear body of evidence that systolic blood pressure over 140 mmHg is harmful suggests that clinicians should promptly initiate and titrate therapy in an ongoing fashion to achieve and maintain systolic blood pressure below 140 mmHg in virtually all patients.</s> <s i="1037">Additionally, patients with long life expectancy (in whom there may be renal benefits from long-term stricter blood pressure control) or those in whom stroke risk is a concern might, as  part  of  shared  decision  making, appropriately have lower systolic targets such as <130 mmHg.</s> <s i="1038">This would especially be the case if this can be achieved with few drugs and without side effects of therapy.</s>

<s i="1039">Treatment strategies

Although there are no well-controlled studies of diet and exercise in the treatment of elevated blood pressure or hypertension in individuals with diabetes, the DASH study in nondiabetic individuals has shown antihypertensive effects similar to pharmacological monotherapy.</s> <s i="1040">Lifestyle therapy consists of reducing sodium intake (to below 1,500 mg/day) and excess body weight; increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables (8–10 servings per day), and low-fat dairy products (2–3 servings per day); avoiding excessive alcohol consumption (no more than two servings per day for men and no more than one serving per day for women) (264); and increasing activity levels (252).</s> <s i="1041">These nonpharmacological strategies may also positively affect glycemia and lipid control and as a result should be encouraged in those with even mildly elevated blood pressure.</s> <s i="1042">Their effects on cardiovascular events have not been established.</s> <s i="1043">Nonpharmacological therapy is reasonable in diabetic individuals with mildly elevated blood pressure (systolic blood pressure >120 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >80 mmHg).</s> <s i="1044">If the blood pressure is confirmed to be >=140 mmHg systolic and/or >=80 mmHg diastolic, pharmacological therapy should be initiated along with nonpharmacological therapy (252).</s>

<s i="1045">Lowering of blood pressure with regimens based on a variety of antihypertensive drugs, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs, b-blockers, diuretics, and calcium channel blockers, has been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular events.</s> <s i="1046">Several studies suggested that ACE inhibitors may be superior to dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers in reducing cardiovascular events (265–267).</s> <s i="1047">However, a variety of other studies have shown no specific advantage to ACE inhibitors as initial treatment of hypertension in the general hypertensive population, but rather an advantage on cardiovascular outcomes of initial therapy with low-dose thiazide diuretics (252,268,269).</s>

<s i="1048">In people with diabetes, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may have unique advantages for initial or early therapy of hypertension.</s> <s i="1049">In a nonhypertension trial of high-risk individuals, including a large subset with diabetes, an ACE inhibitor reduced CVD outcomes (270).</s> <s i="1050">In patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), including diabetic subgroups, ARBs have been shown to reduce major CVD outcomes (271–274), and in type 2 diabetic patients with significant nephropathy, ARBs were superior to calcium channel blockers for reducing heart failure (275).</s> <s i="1051">Though evidence for distinct advantages of RAS inhibitors on CVD outcomes in diabetes remains conflicting (255,269), the high CVD risks associated with diabetes, and the high prevalence of undiagnosed CVD, may still favor recommendations for their use as first-line hypertension therapy in people with diabetes (252).</s>

<s i="1052">Recently, the blood pressure arm of the ADVANCE trial demonstrated that routine administration of a fixed combination of the ACE inhibitor perindopril and the diuretic indapamide significantly reduced combined microvascular and macrovascular outcomes, as well as CVD and total mortality.</s> <s i="1053">The improved outcomes could also have been due to lower achieved blood pressure in the perindopril-indapamide arm (259).</s> <s i="1054">Another trial showed a decrease in morbidity and mortality in those receiving benazepril and amlodipine compared with benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ).</s> <s i="1055">The compelling benefits of RAS inhibitors in diabetic patients with albuminuria or renal insufficiency provide additional rationale for use of these agents (see Section VI.B).</s> <s i="1056">If needed to achieve blood pressure targets, amlodipine, HCTZ, or chlorthalidone can be added.</s> <s i="1057">If eGFR is <30 mL/min/m2, a loop diuretic rather than HCTZ

or chlorthalidone should be prescribed.</s> <s i="1058">Titration of and/or addition of further blood pressure medications should be made in timely fashion to overcome clinical inertia in achieving blood pressure targets.</s>

<s i="1059">Evidence is emerging that health information technology can be used safely and effectively as a tool to enable attainment of blood  pressure  goals.</s>  <s i="1060">Using a telemonitoring intervention to direct titrations of antihypertensive medications between medical office visits has been demonstrated to have a profound impact on systolic blood pressure control (276).</s>

<s i="1061">An important caveat is that most patients with hypertension require multiple-drug therapy to reach treatment goals (252).</s> <s i="1062">Identifying and addressing barriers to medication adherence (such as cost and side effects) should routinely be done.</s> <s i="1063">If blood pressure is refractory despite confirmed adherence to optimal doses of at least three antihypertensive agents of different classifications, one of which should be a diuretic, clinicians should consider an evaluation for secondary forms of hypertension.</s> <s i="1064">Growing evidence suggests that there is an association between increase in sleep-time blood pressure and incidence of CVD events.</s> <s i="1065">A recent RCT of 448 participants with type 2 diabetes and hypertension demonstrated reduced cardiovascular events and mortality with median follow-up of 5.4 years if at least one antihypertensive medication was given at bedtime (277).</s>

<s i="1066">During pregnancy in diabetic women with chronic hypertension, target blood pressure goals of systolic blood pressure 110–129 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure 65–79 mmHg are reasonable, as they contribute to long-term maternal health.</s> <s i="1067">Lower blood pressure levels may be associated with impaired fetal growth.</s> <s i="1068">During pregnancy, treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs is contraindicated because they can cause fetal damage.</s> <s i="1069">Antihypertensive drugs known to be effective and safe in pregnancy include methyldopa, labetalol, diltiazem, clonidine, and prazosin.</s> <s i="1070">Chronic diuretic use during pregnancy has been associated with restricted maternal plasma volume, which might reduce uteroplacental perfusion (278).</s>

Evidence for benefits of lipid-lowering therapy

Patients with type 2 diabetes have an increased prevalence of lipid abnormalities, contributing to their high risk of CVD.</s> <s i="1084">Multiple clinical trials demonstrated significant effects of pharmacological (primarily statin) therapy on CVD outcomes in subjects with CHD and for primary CVD prevention (279,280).</s> <s i="1085">Subanalyses of diabetic subgroups of larger trials (281–285) and trials specifically in subjects with diabetes (286,287) showed significant primary and secondary prevention of CVD events 1/2 CHD deaths in diabetic populations.</s> <s i="1086">Meta-analyses including data from over 18,000 patients with diabetes from 14 randomized trials of statin therapy, followed for a mean of 4.3 years, demonstrate a 9% proportional reduction in all-cause mortality and 13% reduction in vascular mortality, for each mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol (288).</s> <s i="1087">As is the case in nondiabetic individuals, absolute reductions in “hard” CVD outcomes (CHD death and nonfatal MI) are greatest in people with high baseline CVD risk (known CVD and/or very high LDL cholesterol levels), but overall the benefits of statin therapy in people with diabetes at moderate or high risk for CVD are convincing.</s>

<s i="1088">There is an increased risk of incident diabetes with statin use (289,290), which may be limited to those with risk factors for diabetes.</s> <s i="1089">These patients may benefit additionally from diabetes screening when on statin therapy.</s> <s i="1090">In an analysis of one of the initial studies suggesting that statins are linked to risk of diabetes, the cardiovascular event rate reduction with statins outweighed the risk of incident diabetes even for patients at highest risk for diabetes.</s> <s i="1091">The absolute risk increase was small (over 5 years of follow-up, 1.2% of participants on placebo developed diabetes and 1.5% on rosuvastatin) (291).</s> <s i="1092">The relative risk-benefit ratio favoring statins is further supported by meta-analysis of individual data of over 170,000 persons from 27 randomized trials.</s> <s i="1093">This demonstrated that individuals at low risk of vascular disease, including those undergoing primary prevention, received benefits from statins that included reductions in major vascular events and vascular death without increase in incidence of cancer or deaths from other causes (280).</s>

<s i="1094">Low levels of HDL cholesterol, often associated with elevated triglyceride levels, are the most prevalent pattern of dyslipidemia in persons with type 2 diabetes.</s> <s i="1095">However, the evidence base for drugs that target these lipid fractions is significantly less robust than that for statin therapy (292).</s> <s i="1096">Nicotinic acid has been shown to reduce CVD outcomes (293), although the study was done in a nondiabetic cohort.</s> <s i="1097">Gemfibrozil has been shown to decrease rates of CVD events in subjects without diabetes (294,295) and in the diabetic subgroup of one of the larger trials (294).</s> <s i="1098">However, in a large trial specific to diabetic patients, fenofibrate failed to reduce overall cardiovascular outcomes (296).</s>

<s i="1099">Combination therapy, with a statin and a fibrate or statin and niacin, may be efficacious for treatment for all three lipid fractions, but this combination is associated with an increased risk for abnormal transaminase levels, myositis, or rhabdomyolysis.</s> <s i="1100">The risk of rhabdomyolysis is higher with higher doses of statins and with renal insufficiency and seems to be lower when statins are combined with fenofibrate than gemfibrozil (297).</s> <s i="1101">In the ACCORD study, the combination of fenofibrate and simvastatin did not reduce the rate of fatal cardiovascular events, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke, as compared with simvastatin alone, in patients with type 2 diabetes who were at high risk for CVD.</s> <s i="1102">Prespecified subgroup analyses suggested heterogeneity in treatment effects according to sex, with a benefit of combination therapy for men and possible harm for women, and a possible benefit for patients with both triglyceride level >=204 mg/dL and HDL cholesterol level <=34 mg/dL (298).</s> <s i="1103">The AIM-HIGH trial randomized over 3,000 patients (about one-third with diabetes) with established CVD, low levels of HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels of 150–400 mg/dL to statin therapy plus extended release niacin or matching placebo.</s> <s i="1104">The trial was halted early due to lack of efficacy on the primary CVD outcome and a possible increase in ischemic stroke in those on combination therapy (299).</s> <s i="1105">Hence, combination lipid-lowering therapy cannot be broadly recommended.</s>



<s i="1106">Dyslipidemia treatment and target lipid levels

For most patients with diabetes, the first priority of dyslipidemia therapy (unless severe hypertriglyceridemia with risk of pancreatitis is the immediate issue) is to lower LDL cholesterol to a target goal of <100 mg/dL (2.60 mmol/L) (300).</s> <s i="1107">Lifestyle intervention, including MNT, increased physical activity, weight loss, and smoking cessation, may allow some patients to reach lipid goals.</s> <s i="1108">Nutrition intervention should be tailored according to each patient’s age, type of diabetes, pharmacological treatment, lipid levels, and other medical conditions and should focus on the reduction of saturated fat, cholesterol, and trans unsaturated fat intake and increases in n-3 fatty acids, viscous fiber (such as in oats, legumes, citrus), and plant stanols/sterols.</s> <s i="1109">Glycemic control can also beneficially modify plasma lipid levels, particularly in patients with very high triglycerides and poor glycemic control.</s>

<s i="1110">In those with clinical CVD or over age 40 years with other CVD risk factors, pharmacological treatment  should be added to lifestyle therapy regardless of baseline lipid levels.</s> <s i="1111">Statins are the drugs of choice for LDL cholesterol lowering and cardioprotection.</s> <s i="1112">In patients other than those described above, statin treatment should be considered if there is an inadequate LDL cholesterol response to lifestyle modifications and improved glucose control, or if the patient has increased cardiovascular risk (e.g., multiple cardiovascular risk factors or long duration of diabetes).</s> <s i="1113">Very little clinical trial evidence exists for type 2 diabetic patients under the age 40 years, or for type 1 diabetic patients of any age.</s> <s i="1114">In the Heart Protection Study (lower age limit 40 years), the subgroup of ;600 patients with type 1 diabetes had a reduction in risk proportionately similar to that of patients with type 2 diabetes, although not statistically significant (282).</s> <s i="1115">Although the data are not definitive, consideration should be given to similar lipid-lowering goals in type 1 diabetic patients as in type 2 diabetic patients, particularly if they have other cardiovascular risk factors.</s>



<s i="1116">Alternative lipoprotein goals

Virtually all trials of statins and CVD outcome tested specific doses of statins against placebo, other doses of statin, or other statins, rather than aiming for specific LDL cholesterol goals (301).</s> <s i="1117">Placebocontrolled trials generally achieved LDL cholesterol reductions of 30–40% from baseline.</s> <s i="1118">Hence, LDL cholesterol lowering of this magnitude is an acceptable outcome for patients who cannot reach LDL cholesterol goals due to severe baseline elevations in LDL cholesterol and/or intolerance of maximal, or any, statin doses.</s> <s i="1119">Additionally for those with baseline LDL cholesterol minimally above 100 mg/dL, prescribing statin therapy to lower LDL cholesterol about 30–40% from baseline is probably more effective than prescribing just enough to get LDL cholesterol slightly below 100 mg/dL.</s>

<s i="1120">Clinical trials in high-risk patients, such as those with acute coronary syndromes or previous cardiovascular events (302–304), have demonstrated that more aggressive therapy with high doses of statins to achieve an LDL cholesterol of ,70 mg/dL led to a significant reduction in further events.</s> <s i="1121">Therefore, a reduction in LDL cholesterol to a goal of ,70 mg/dL is an option in very high-risk diabetic patients with overt CVD (305).</s> <s i="1122">Some experts recommend a greater focus on non–HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (apoB), or lipoprotein particle measurements to assess residual CVD risk in statin-treated patients who are likely to have small LDL particles, such as people with diabetes (306), but it is unclear whether clinical management would change with these measurements.</s>

<s i="1123">In individual patients, LDL cholesterol lowering with statins is highly variable, and this variable response is poorly understood (307).</s> <s i="1124">Reduction of CVD events with statins correlates very closely with LDL cholesterol lowering (279).</s> <s i="1125">If initial attempts to prescribe a statin leads to side effects, clinicians should attempt to find a dose or alternative statin that the patient can tolerate.</s> <s i="1126">There is evidence for significant LDL cholesterol lowering from even extremely low, less than daily, statin doses (308).</s> <s i="1127">When maximally tolerated doses of statins fail to significantly lower LDL cholesterol (,30% reduction from the patient’s baseline), there is no strong evidence that combination therapy should be used to achieve additional LDL cholesterol lowering.</s> <s i="1128">Niacin, fenofibrate, ezetimibe, and bile acid sequestrants all offer additional LDL cholesterol lowering to statins alone, but without evidence that such combination therapy for LDL cholesterol lowering provides a significant increment in CVD risk reduction over statin therapy alone.</s>



<s i="1129">Treatment of other lipoprotein fractions or targets

Hypertriglyceridemia should be addressed with dietary and lifestyle changes.</s> <s i="1130">Severe hypertriglyceridemia (<1,000 mg/dL) may warrant immediate pharmacological therapy (fibric acid derivative, niacin, or fish oil) to reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis.</s> <s i="1131">In the absence of severe hypertriglyceridemia, therapy targeting HDL cholesterol or triglycerides lacks the strong evidence base of statin therapy.</s> <s i="1132">If the HDL cholesterol is <40 mg/dL and the LDL cholesterol is between 100 and 129 mg/dL, a fibrate or niacin might be used, especially if a patient is intolerant to statins.</s> <s i="1133">Niacin is the most effective drug for raising HDL cholesterol.</s> <s i="1134">It can significantly increase blood glucose at high doses, but at modest doses (750–2,000 mg/day) significant improvements in LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels are accompanied by only modest changes in glucose that are generally amenable to adjustment of diabetes therapy (299,309,310).</s>

<s i="1157">Based on the currently available evidence, aspirin appears to have a modest effect on ischemic vascular events with the absolute decrease in events depending on the underlying CVD risk.</s> <s i="1158">The main adverse effects appear to be an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.</s> <s i="1159">The excess risk may be as high as 1–5 per 1,000 per year in real-world settings.</s> <s i="1160">In adults with CVD risk greater than 1% per year, the number of CVD events prevented will be similar to or greater than the number of episodes of bleeding induced, although these complications do not have equal effects on long-term health (314).</s>

 

<s i="1161">In 2010, a position statement of the ADA, the American Heart Association (AHA), and the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) updated prior joint recommendations for primary prevention (315).</s> <s i="1162">Low-dose (75–162 mg/day) aspirin use for primary prevention is reasonable for adults with diabetes and no previous history of vascular disease who are at increased CVD risk (10year risk of CVD events over 10%) and who are not at increased risk for bleeding.</s> <s i="1163">This generally includes most men over age 50 years and women over age 60 years who also have one or more of the following major risk factors: 1) smoking, 2) hypertension, 3) dyslipidemia, 4) family history of premature CVD, and 5) albuminuria.</s>

<s i="1164">However, aspirin is no longer recommended for those at low CVD risk (women under age 60 years and men under age 50 years with no major CVD risk factors; 10-year CVD risk under 5%) as the low benefit is likely to be outweighed by the risks of significant bleeding.</s> <s i="1165">Clinical judgment should be used for those at intermediate risk (younger patients with one or more risk factors, or older patients with no risk factors; those with 10-year CVD risk of 5–10%) until further research is available.</s> <s i="1166">Use of aspirin in patients under the age of 21 years is contraindicated due to the associated risk of Reye syndrome.</s>

<s i="1234">Intensive diabetes management with the goal of achieving near-normoglycemia has been shown in large prospective randomized studies to delay the onset and progression of increased urinary albumin excretion   in   patients   with   type   1 (335,336) and type 2 (83,84,88,89) diabetes.</s> <s i="1235">The UKPDS provided strong evidence that control of blood pressure can reduce the development of nephropathy (255).</s> <s i="1236">In addition, large prospective randomized studies in patients with type 1 diabetes have demonstrated that achievement of lower levels of systolic blood pressure (<140 mmHg) resulting from treatment using ACE inhibitors provides a selective benefit over other antihypertensive drug classes in delaying the progression of increased urinary albumin excretion and can slow the decline in GFR in patients with higher levels of albuminuria (337– 339).</s> <s i="1237">In type 2 diabetes with hypertension and normoalbuminuria, RAS inhibition has been demonstrated to delay onset of microalbuminuria (340,341).</s> <s i="1238">In the latter study, there was an unexpected higher rate of fatal cardiovascular events with olmesartan among patients with preexisting CHD.</s>

<s i="1245">Studies in patients with varying stages of nephropathy have shown that protein restriction of dietary protein helps slow the progression of albuminuria, GFR decline, and occurrence of ESRD (354–357), although more recent studies have provided conflicting results (140).</s> <s i="1246">Dietary protein restriction might be considered particularly in patients whose nephropathy seems to be progressing despite optimal glucose and blood pressure control and use of ACE inhibitor and/or ARBs (357).</s>

Care and close supervision of diabetes management is increasingly shifted from parents and other older adults throughout childhood and adolescence.</s> <s i="1528">However, the shift from pediatrics to adult health care providers often occurs very abruptly as the older teen enters the next developmental stage referred to as emerging adulthood (443), a critical period for young people who have diabetes; during this period of major life transitions, youth begin to move out of their parents’ home and must become more fully responsible for their diabetes care including the many aspects of self management, making medical appointments, and financing health care once they are no longer covered under their parents’ health insurance (444,445).</s> <s i="1529">In addition to lapses in health care, this is also a period of deterioration in glycemic control, increased occurrence of acute complications, psycho-socialemotional-behavioral issues, and emergence of chronic complications (444–447).</s>

Major congenital malformations remain the leading cause of mortality and serious morbidity in infants of mothers with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.</s> <s i="1554">Observational studies indicate that the risk of malformations increases continuously with increasing maternal glycemia during the first 6–8 weeks of gestation, as defined by first-trimester A1C concentrations.</s> <s i="1555">There is no threshold for A1C values below which risk disappears entirely.</s> <s i="1556">However, malformation rates above the 1–2% background rate of nondiabetic pregnancies appear to be limited to pregnancies in which first-trimester A1C concentrations are >1% above the normal range for a nondiabetic pregnant woman.</s>

<s i="1564">Planned pregnancies greatly facilitate preconception diabetes care.</s> <s i="1565">Unfortunately, nearly two-thirds of pregnancies in women with diabetes are unplanned, leading to a persistent excess of malformations in infants of diabetic mothers.</s> <s i="1566">To minimize the occurrence of these devastating malformations, standard care for all women with diabetes who have childbearing potential, beginning at the onset of puberty or at diagnosis, should include 1) education about the risk of malformations associated with unplanned pregnancies and poor metabolic control and 2) use of effective contraception at all times, unless the patient has good metabolic control and is actively trying to conceive.</s>

<s i="1567">Women contemplating pregnancy need to be seen frequently by a multidisciplinary team experienced in the management of diabetes before and during pregnancy.</s> <s i="1568">The goals of preconception care are to 1) involve and empower the patient in the management of her diabetes, 2) achieve the lowest A1C test results possible without excessive hypoglycemia, 3) assure effective contraception until stable and acceptable glycemia is achieved, and 4) identify, evaluate, and treat longterm diabetes complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, hypertension, and CHD (106).</s>

<s i="1700">There are no data on the safety and efficacy of oral agents and injectable noninsulin therapies such as GLP-1 analogs and pramlintide in the hospital.</s> <s i="1701">They are generally considered to have a limited role in the management of hyperglycemia in conjunction with acute illness.</s> <s i="1702">Continuation of these agents may be appropriate in selected stable patients who are expected to consume meals at regular intervals, and they may be initiated or resumed in anticipation of discharge once the patient is clinically stable.</s> <s i="1703">Specific caution is required with metformin, due to the possibility that a contraindication may develop during the hospitalization, such as renal insufficiency, unstable hemodynamic status, or need for an imaging study that requires a radio-contrast dye.</s>

<s i="1704">3.</s>	<s i="1705">Preventing hypoglycemia

In the hospital, multiple risk factors for hypoglycemia are present.</s> <s i="1706">Patients with or without diabetes may experience hypoglycemia in the hospital in association with altered nutritional state, heart failure, renal or liver disease, malignancy, infection, or sepsis.</s> <s i="1707">Additional triggering events leading to iatrogenic hypoglycemia include sudden reduction of corticosteroid dose, altered ability of the patient to report symptoms, reduction of oral intake, emesis, new NPO status, inappropriate timing of shortor rapid-acting insulin in relation to meals, reduction of rate of administration of intravenous dextrose, and unexpected interruption of enteral feedings or parenteral nutrition.</s>

<s i="1708">Despite the preventable nature of many inpatient episodes of hypoglycemia, institutions are more likely to have nursing protocols for the treatment of hypoglycemia than for its prevention.</s> <s i="1709">Tracking such episodes and analyzing their causes are important quality-improvement activities (468).</s>

<s i="1710">4.</s>	<s i="1711">Diabetes care providers in the hospital

Inpatient diabetes management may be effectively championed and/or provided by primary care physicians, endocrinologists, intensivists, or hospitalists.</s> <s i="1712">Involvement of appropriately trained specialists or specialty teams may reduce length of stay, improve glycemic control, and improve outcomes (468).</s> <s i="1713">In the care of diabetes, implementation of standardized order sets for scheduled and correctiondose insulin may reduce reliance on sliding-scale management.</s> <s i="1714">As hospitals move to comply with “meaningful use” regulations for electronic health records, as mandated by the Health Information Technology Act, efforts should be made to assure that all components of structured insulin order sets are incorporated into electronic insulin order sets (477,478).</s> 

<s i="1715">A team approach is needed to establish hospital pathways.</s> <s i="1716">To achieve glycemic targets associated with improved hospital outcomes, hospitals will need multidisciplinary support to develop insulin management protocols that effectively and safely enable achievement of glycemic targets (479).</s>

<s i="1717">5.</s>	<s i="1718">Self-management in the hospital

Self-management of diabetes in the hospital may be appropriate for competent adult patients who have a stable level of consciousness, have reasonably stable daily insulin requirements, successfully conduct self-management of diabetes at home, have physical skills needed to successfully self-administer insulin and perform SMBG, have adequate oral intake, and are proficient in carbohydrate counting, use of multiple daily insulin injections or insulin pump therapy, and sick-day management.</s> <s i="1719">The patient and physician, in consultation with nursing staff, must agree that patient selfmanagement is appropriate under the conditions of hospitalization.</s>

<s i="1720">Patients who use CSII pump therapy in the outpatient setting can be candidates for diabetes self-management in the hospital, provided that they have the mental and physical capacity to do so (468).</s> <s i="1721">A hospital policy and procedures delineating inpatient guidelines for CSII therapy are advisable, and availability of hospital personnel with expertise in CSII therapy is essential.</s> <s i="1722">It is important that nursing personnel document basal rates and bolus doses taken on a regular basis (at least daily).</s>

<s i="1723">6.</s>	<s i="1724">MNT in the hospital

The goals of MNT are to optimize glycemic control, to provide adequate calories to meet metabolic demands, and to create a discharge plan for follow-up care (457,480).</s> <s i="1725">The ADA does not endorse any single meal plan or specified percentages of macronutrients, and the term “ADA diet” should no longer be used.</s> <s i="1726">Current nutrition recommendations advise individualization based on treatment goals, physiological parameters, and medication usage.</s> <s i="1727">Consistent carbohydrate meal plans are preferred by many hospitals because they facilitate matching the prandial insulin dose to the amount of carbohydrate consumed (481).</s> <s i="1728">Because of the complexity of nutrition issues in the hospital, a registered dietitian, knowledgeable and skilled in MNT, should serve as an inpatient team member.</s> <s i="1729">The dietitian is responsible for integrating information about the patient’s clinical condition, eating, and lifestyle habits and for establishing treatment goals in order to determine a realistic plan for nutrition therapy (482,483).</s>

<s i="1730">7.</s>	<s i="1731">Bedside  blood  glucose  monitoring POC  blood  glucose  monitoring  performed at the bedside is used to guide insulin  dosing.</s>  <s i="1732">In  the  patient  who  is receiving nutrition, the timing of glucose monitoring should match carbohydrate exposure.</s> <s i="1733">In the patient who is not receiving nutrition, glucose monitoring is performed every 4 to 6 h (484,485).</s> <s i="1734">More frequent blood glucose testing ranging from every 30 min to every 2 h is required for patients on intravenous insulin infusions.</s>

<s i="1735">Safety standards should be established for blood glucose monitoring prohibiting sharing of finger-stick lancing devices, lancets, needles, and meters to reduce the risk of transmission of blood borne diseases.</s> <s i="1736">Shared lancing devices carry essentially the same risk as is conferred from sharing of syringes and needles (486).</s>

<s i="1737">Accuracy of blood glucose measurements using POC meters has limitations that must be considered.</s> <s i="1738">Although the FDA allows a 1/2 20% error for blood glucose meters, questions about the appropriateness of these criteria have been raised (388).</s> <s i="1739">Glucose measures differ significantly between plasma and whole blood, terms that are often used interchangeably and can lead to misinterpretation.</s> <s i="1740">Most commercially available capillary blood glucose meters introduce a correction factor of ;1.12 to report a “plasma-adjusted” value (487).</s>

<s i="1741">Significant discrepancies between capillary, venous, and arterial plasma samples have been observed in patients with low or high hemoglobin concentrations, hypoperfusion, and the presence of interfering substances particularly maltose, as contained in immunoglobulins (488).</s> <s i="1742">Analytical variability has been described with several POC meters (489).</s> <s i="1743">Increasingly newer generation POC blood glucose meters correct for variation in hematocrit and for interfering substances.</s> <s i="1744">Any glucose result that does not correlate with the patient’s status should be confirmed through conventional laboratory sampling of plasma glucose.</s> <s i="1745">The FDA has become increasingly concerned about the use of POC blood glucose meters in the hospital and is presently reviewing matters related to their use.</s>

<s i="1746">8.</s>	<s i="1747">Discharge planning and DSME

Transition from the acute care setting is a high-risk time for all patients, not just those with diabetes or new hyperglycemia.</s> <s i="1748">Although there is an extensive literature concerning safe  transition  within  and from the hospital, little of it is specific to diabetes (490).</s> <s i="1749">It is important to remember that diabetes discharge planning is not a separate entity, but is part of an overall discharge plan.</s> <s i="1750">As such, discharge planning begins at admission to the hospital and is updated as projected patient needs change.</s>

<s i="1751">Inpatients may be discharged to varied settings, including home (with or without visiting nurse services), assisted living, rehabilitation, or skilled nursing facilities.</s> <s i="1752">The latter two sites are generally staffed by health professionals, so diabetes discharge planning will be limited to communication of medication and diet orders.</s> <s i="1753">For the patient who is discharged to assisted living or to home, the optimal program will need to consider the type and severity of diabetes, the effects of the patient’s illness on blood glucose levels, and the capacities and desires of the patient.</s> <s i="1754">Smooth transition to outpatient care should be ensured.</s> <s i="1755">The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) recommends that at a minimum, discharge plans include the following:

c Medication reconciliation: The patient’s medications must be crosschecked to ensure that no chronic medications were stopped and to ensure the safety of new prescriptions.</s>

<s i="1756">• Whenever possible, prescriptions for new or changed medication should be filled and reviewed with the patient and family at or before discharge.</s>

<s i="1757">• Structured discharge communication: Information on medication changes, pending tests and studies, and follow-up needs must be accurately and promptly communicated to outpatient physicians.</s>

<s i="1758">• Discharge summaries should be transmitted to the primary physician as soon as possible after discharge.</s>

<s i="1759">• Appointment keeping behavior is enhanced  when  the  inpatient  team schedules outpatient medical followup prior to discharge.</s> <s i="1760">Ideally the inpatient care providers or case managers/ discharge planners will schedule follow-up visit(s) with the appropriate professionals, including the primary care provider, endocrinologist, and diabetes educator (491).</s>

<s i="1761">Teaching diabetes self-management to patients in hospitals is a challenging task.</s> <s i="1762">Patients are ill, under increased stress related to their hospitalization and diagnosis, and in an environment not conducive to learning.</s> <s i="1763">Ideally, people with diabetes should be taught at a time and place conducive to learning: as an outpatient in a recognized program of diabetes education.</s> <s i="1764">For the hospitalized patient, diabetes “survival skills” education is generally a feasible approach to provide sufficient information and training to enable safe care at home.</s> <s i="1765">Patients hospitalized because of a crisis related to diabetes management or poor care at home need education to prevent subsequent episodes of hospitalization.</s> <s i="1766">An assessment of the need for a home health referral or referral to an outpatient diabetes education program should be part of discharge planning for all patients.</s>

<s i="1767">DSME cannot wait until discharge, especially in those new to insulin therapy or in whom the diabetes regimen has been substantially altered during the hospitalization.</s>

<s i="1768">It is recommended that the following areas of knowledge be reviewed and addressed prior to hospital discharge:

c Identification of health care provider who will provide diabetes care after discharge

c Level of understanding related to the diagnosis of diabetes, SMBG, and explanation of home blood glucose goals

c Definition, recognition, treatment, and prevention of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia

c Information on consistent eating patterns

c When and how to take blood glucose– lowering medications including insulin administration (if going home on insulin)

c  Sick-day management

c Proper use and disposal of needles and syringes

It is important that patients be provided with appropriate durable medical equipment, medication, supplies, and prescriptions at the time of discharge in order to avoid a potentially dangerous hiatus in care.</s> <s i="1769">These supplies/prescriptions should include the following:

c   Insulin (vials or pens) if needed

c  Syringes or pen needles (if needed)

c Oral medications (if needed)

c   Blood glucose meter and strips

c  Lancets and lancing device

c  Urine ketone strips (type 1)

c  Glucagon emergency kit (insulin-treated)

c  Medical alert application/charm

More expanded diabetes education can be arranged in the community.</s> <s i="1770">An outpatient follow-up visit with the primary care provider, endocrinologist, or diabetes educator within 1 month of discharge is advised for all patients having hyperglycemia in the hospital.</s> <s i="1771">Clear communication with outpatient providers either directly or via hospital discharge summaries facilitates safe transitions to outpatient care.</s> <s i="1772">Providing information regarding the cause or the plan for determining the cause of hyperglycemia, related complications and comorbidities, and recommended treatments can assist outpatient providers as they assume ongoing care.</s>

<s i="1773">B.</s>	<s i="1774">Diabetes and employment

Any person with diabetes, whether insulin treated or noninsulin treated, should be eligible for any employment for which he/she is otherwise qualified.</s> <s i="1775">Employment decisions should never be based on generalizations or stereotypes regarding the effects of diabetes.</s> <s i="1776">When questions arise about the medical fitness of a person with diabetes for a particular job, a health care professional with expertise in treating diabetes should perform an individualized assessment.</s> <s i="1777">See the ADA position statement on diabetes and employment (492).</s>

<s i="1778">C.</s>	<s i="1779">Diabetes and driving

A large percentage of people with diabetes in the U.S. and elsewhere seek a license to drive, either for personal or employment purposes.</s> <s i="1780">There has been considerable debate whether, and the extent to which, diabetes may be a relevant factor in determining the driver ability and eligibility for a license.</s>

<s i="1781">People with diabetes are subject to a great variety of licensing requirements applied by both state and federal jurisdictions, which  may lead  to loss of employment or significant restrictions on a person’s license.</s> <s i="1782">Presence of a medical condition that can lead to significantly impaired consciousness or cognition may lead to drivers being evaluated for fitness to drive.</s> <s i="1783">For diabetes, this typically arises when the person has had a hypoglycemic episode behind the wheel, even if this did not lead to a motor vehicle accident.</s>

<s i="1784">Epidemiological and simulator data suggest that people with insulin-treated diabetes have a small increase in risk of motor vehicle accidents, primarily due to hypoglycemia and decreased awareness of hypoglycemia.</s> <s i="1785">This increase (RR 1.12– 1.19) is much smaller than the risks associated with teenage male drivers (RR 42), driving at night (RR 142), driving on rural roads compared with urban roads (RR 9.2), and obstructive sleep apnea (RR 2.4), all of which are accepted for unrestricted licensure.</s>

<s i="1786">The ADA position statement on diabetes and driving (493) recommends against blanket restrictions based on the diagnosis of diabetes and urges individual assessment by a health care professional knowledgeable in diabetes if restrictions on licensure are being considered.</s> <s i="1787">Patients should be evaluated for decreased awareness of hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia episodes while driving, or severe hypoglycemia.</s> <s i="1788">Patients with retinopathy or peripheral neuropathy require assessment to determine if those complications interfere with operation of a motor vehicle.</s> <s i="1789">Health care professionals should be cognizant of the potential risk of driving with diabetes and counsel their patients about detecting and avoiding hypoglycemia while driving.</s>



<s i="1790">D.</s>	<s i="1791">Diabetes management in correctional institutions

People with diabetes in correctional facilities should receive care that meets national standards.</s> <s i="1792">Because it is estimated that nearly 80,000 inmates have diabetes, correctional institutions should have written policies and procedures for the management of diabetes and for training of medical and correctional staff in diabetes care practices.</s> <s i="1793">See the ADA position statement on diabetes management in correctional institutions (494) for further discussion.</s>



<s i="1794">X.</s>	<s i="1795">STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING DIABETES CARE



Recommendations

c Care should be aligned with components of the Chronic Care Model (CCM) to ensure productive interactions between a prepared proactive practice team and an informed activated patient. (A)</s> <s i="1796">

c When feasible, care systems should support team-based care, community involvement, patient registries, and embedded decision support tools to meet patient needs. (B)</s> <s i="1797">

c Treatment decisions should be timely and based on evidence-based guidelines that are tailored to individual patient preferences, prognoses, and comorbidities. (B)</s> <s i="1798">

c A patient-centered communication style should be employed that incorporates patient preferences, assesses literacy and numeracy, and addresses cultural barriers to care. (B)</s> <s i="1799">



There has been steady improvement in the proportion of diabetic patients achieving recommended levels of A1C, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol in the last 10 years, both in primary care settings and in endocrinology practices.</s> <s i="1800">Mean A1C nationally has declined from 7.82% in 1999– 2000 to 7.18% in 2004 based on NHANES data (495).</s> <s i="1801">This has been accompanied by improvements in lipids and blood pressure control and led to substantial reductions in end-stage microvascular complications in those with diabetes.</s> <s i="1802">Nevertheless in some studies only 57.1% of adults with diagnosed diabetes achieved an A1C of <7%, only 45.5% had a blood pressure <130/80 mmHg, and just 46.5% had a total cholesterol <200 mg/dL, with only 12.2% of people with diabetes achieving all three treatment goals (496).</s> <s i="1803">Evidence also suggests that progress in risk factor control may be slowing (497).</s> <s i="1804">Certain patient groups, such as patients with complex comorbidities, financial or other social hardships, and/or limited English proficiency, may present particular challenges to goalbased care (498,499).</s> <s i="1805">Persistent variation in quality of diabetes care across providers and across practice settings even after adjusting for patient factors indicates that there remains potential for substantial further improvements in diabetes care.</s>

<s i="1806">Although numerous interventions to improve adherence to the recommended standards have been implemented, a major barrier to optimal care is a delivery system that too often is fragmented, lacks clinical information capabilities, often duplicates services, and is poorly designed for the coordinated delivery of chronic care.</s> <s i="1807">The CCM has been shown in numerous studies to be an effective framework for improving the quality of diabetes care (500).</s> <s i="1808">The CCM includes six core elements for the provision of optimal care of patients with chronic disease: 1) delivery system design (moving from a reactive to a proactive care delivery system where planned visits are coordinated through a team based approach), 2) self-management support, 3) decision support (basing care on evidence-based, effective care guidelines), 4) clinical information systems (using registries that can provide patient-specific and populationbased support to the care team), 5) community resources and policies (identifying or developing resources to support healthy lifestyles), and 6) health systems (to create a quality-oriented culture).</s> <s i="1809">Redefinition of the roles of the clinic staff and promoting self-management on the part of the patient are fundamental to the successful implementation of the CCM (501).</s> <s i="1810">Collaborative, multidisciplinary teams are best suited to provide such care for people with chronic conditions such as diabetes and to facilitate patients’ performance of appropriate self-management   (163,165,220,502).</s>

<s i="1811">NDEP maintains an online resource (www.betterdiabetescare.nih.gov) to help health care professionals design and implement more effective health care delivery systems for those with diabetes.</s> <s i="1812">Three specific objectives, with references to literature that outlines practical strategies to achieve each, are outlined below.</s>



<s i="1813">Objective 1: Optimize provider and team behavior

The care team should prioritize timely and appropriate intensification of lifestyle and/ or pharmaceutical therapy of patients who have not achieved beneficial levels of blood pressure, lipid, or glucose control (503).</s> <s i="1814">Strategies such as explicit goal setting with patients (504); identifying and addressing language, numeracy, or cultural barriers to care (505–508); integrating evidence-based guidelines and clinical information tools into the process of care (509–511); and incorporating care management teams including nurses, pharmacists, and other providers (512–515) have each been shown to optimize provider and team behavior and thereby catalyze reduction in A1C, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol.</s>

 
<s i="1815">Objective 2: Support patient behavior change

Successful diabetes care requires a systematic approach to supporting patients’ behavior change efforts, including a) healthy lifestyle changes (physical activity, healthy eating, nonuse of tobacco, weight management, effective coping), b)	disease self-management (medication taking and management; self-monitoring of glucose and blood pressure when clinically appropriate), and •) prevention of diabetes complications (self-monitoring of foot health; active participation in screening for eye, foot, and renal complications; immunizations).</s> <s i="1816">High-quality DSME has been shown to improve patient self-management, satisfaction, and glucose control (184,516), as has delivery of ongoing DSMS so that gains achieved during DSME are sustained (134,135,152).</s> <s i="1817">National DSME standards call for an integrated approach that includes clinical content and skills, behavioral strategies (goal-setting, problem solving), and addressing emotional concerns in each needed curriculum content area.</s>

<s i="1818">Objective 3: Change the system of care

The most successful practices have an institutional priority for providing high quality of care (517).</s> <s i="1819">Changes that have been shown to increase quality of diabetes care include basing care on evidence-based guidelines (518), expanding the role of teams and staff (501,519), redesigning the processes of care (520), implementing electronic health record tools (521,522), activating and educating patients (523,524), and identifying and/or developing and engaging community resources and public policy that support healthy lifestyles (525).</s> <s i="1820">Recent initiatives such as the Patient-Centered Medical Home show promise to improve outcomes through coordinated primary care and offer new opportunities for team-based chronic disease care (526).</s> <s i="1821">Alterations in reimbursement that reward the provision of appropriate and high-quality care rather than visitbased billing (527) and that can accommodate the need to personalize care goals may provide additional incentives to improve diabetes care (528).</s>

<s i="1822">It is clear that optimal diabetes management requires an organized, systematic approach and involvement of a coordinated team of dedicated health care professionals working in an environment where patient-centered high-quality care is a priority.</s>

Position Statement

Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus

AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION

DEfiNITION AND DESCRIPTION OF DIABETES MELLITUS
Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both.</s> <s i="3298">The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of different organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels.</s>

<s i="3299">Several pathogenic processes are involved in the development of diabetes.</s> <s i="3300">These range from autoimmune destruction of the b-cells of the pancreas with consequent insulin deficiency to abnormalities that result in resistance to insulin action.</s> <s i="3301">The basis of the abnormalities in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism in diabetes is deficient action of insulin on target tissues.</s> <s i="3302">Deficient insulin action results from inadequate insulin secretion and/or diminished tissue responses to insulin at one or more points in the complex pathways of hormone action.</s> <s i="3303">Impairment of insulin secretion and defects in insulin action frequently coexist in the same patient, and it is often unclear which abnormality, if either alone, is the primary cause of the hyperglycemia.</s>

<s i="3304">Symptoms of marked hyperglycemia include polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, sometimes with polyphagia, and blurred vision.</s> <s i="3305">Impairment of growth and susceptibility to certain infections may also accompany chronic hyperglycemia.</s> <s i="3306">Acute, life-threatening consequences of uncontrolled diabetes are hyperglycemia with ketoacidosis or the nonketotic hyperosmolar syndrome.</s>

<s i="3307">Long-term complications of diabetes include retinopathy with potential loss of vision; nephropathy leading to renal failure; peripheral neuropathy with risk of foot ulcers, amputations, and Charcot joints; and autonomic neuropathy causing gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and cardiovascular symptoms and sexual dysfunction.</s> <s i="3308">Patients with diabetes have an increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular, peripheral arterial, and cerebrovascular disease.</s> <s i="3309">Hypertension and abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism are often found in people with diabetes.</s>

<s i="3310">The vast majority of cases of diabetes fall into two broad etiopathogenetic categories (discussed in greater detail below).</s> <s i="3311">In one category, type 1 diabetes, the cause is an absolute deficiency of insulin secretion.</s> <s i="3312">Individuals at increased risk of developing this type of diabetes can often be identified by serological evidence of an autoimmune pathologic process occurring in the pancreatic islets and by genetic markers.</s> <s i="3313">In the other, much more prevalent category, type 2 diabetes, the cause is a combination of resistance to insulin action and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response.</s> <s i="3314">In the latter category, a degree of hyperglycemia sufficient to cause pathologic and functional changes in various target tissues, but without clinical symptoms, may be present for a long period of time before diabetes is detected.</s> <s i="3315">During this asymptomatic period, it is possible to demonstrate an abnormality in carbohydrate metabolism by measurement of plasma glucose in the fasting state or after a challenge with an oral glucose load or by A1C.</s>

<s i="3316">The degree of hyperglycemia (if any) may change over time, depending on the extent of the underlying disease process (fig. 1).</s> <s i="3317">A disease process may be present but may not have progressed far enough to cause hyperglycemia.</s> <s i="3318">The same disease process can cause impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) without fulfilling the criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes.</s> <s i="3319">In some individuals with diabetes, adequate glycemic control can be achieved with weight reduction, exercise, and/or oral glucose-lowering agents.</s> <s i="3320">These individuals therefore do not require insulin.</s> <s i="3321">Other individuals who have some residual insulin secretion but require exogenous insulin for adequate glycemic control can survive without it.</s> <s i="3322">Individuals with extensive b-cell destruction and therefore no residual insulin secretion require insulin for survival.</s> <s i="3323">The severity of the metabolic abnormality can progress, regress, or stay the same.</s> <s i="3324">Thus, the degree of hyperglycemia reflects the severity of the underlying metabolic process and its treatment more than the nature of the process itself.</s>

 





<s i="3325">CLASSIfiCATION OF DIABETES MELLITUS AND OTHER CATEGORIES OF GLUCOSE REGULATION
Assigning a type of diabetes to an individual often depends on the circumstances present at the time of diagnosis, and many diabetic individuals do not easily fit into a single class.</s> <s i="3326">For example, a person diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) may continue to be hyperglycemic after delivery and may be determined to have, in fact, type 2 diabetes.</s> <s i="3327">Alternatively, a person who acquires diabetes because of large doses of exogenous steroids may become normoglycemic once the glucocorticoids are discontinued, but then may develop diabetes many years later after recurrent episodes of pancreatitis.</s> <s i="3328">Another example would be a person treated with thiazides who develops diabetes years later.</s> <s i="3329">Because thiazides in themselves seldom cause severe hyperglycemia, such individuals probably have type 2 diabetes that is exacerbated by the drug.</s> <s i="3330">Thus, for the clinician and patient, it is less important to label the particular type of diabetes than it is to understand the pathogenesis of the hyperglycemia and to treat it effectively.</s>

<s i="3331">Type 1 diabetes (b-cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency)

Immune-mediated  diabetes.</s>  <s i="3332">This form of diabetes, which accounts for only 5–10% of those with diabetes, previously encompassed by the terms insulindependent diabetes or juvenile-onset diabetes, results from a cellular-mediated autoimmune destruction of the b-cells of the pancreas.</s> <s i="3333">Markers of the immune destruction of the b-cell include islet cell autoantibodies, autoantibodies to insulin, autoantibodies to GAD (GAD65), and autoantibodies to the tyrosine phosphatases IA-2 and IA-2b.</s> <s i="3334">One and usually more of these autoantibodies are present in 85– 90% of individuals when fasting hyperglycemia is initially detected.</s> <s i="3335">Also, the disease has strong HLA associations, with linkage to the DQA and DQB genes, and it is influenced by the DRB genes.</s> <s i="3336">These HLA-DR/DQ alleles can be either predisposing or protective.

Disorders of glycemia: etiologic types and stages.</s> <s i="3337">*Even after presenting in ketoacidosis, these patients can briefly return to normoglycemia without requiring continuous therapy (i.e., “honeymoon” remission); **in rare instances, patients in these categories (e.g., Vacor toxicity, type 1 diabetes presenting in pregnancy) may require insulin for survival.</s>

<s i="3338">In this form of diabetes, the rate of b-cell destruction is quite variable, being rapid in some individuals (mainly infants and children) and slow in others (mainly adults).</s> <s i="3339">Some patients, particularly children and adolescents, may present with ketoacidosis as the first manifestation of the disease.</s> <s i="3340">Others have modest fasting hyperglycemia that can rapidly change to severe hyperglycemia and/or ketoacidosis in the presence of infection or other stress.</s> <s i="3341">Still others, particularly adults, may retain residual b-cell function sufficient to prevent ketoacidosis for many years; such individuals eventually become dependent on insulin for survival and are at risk for ketoacidosis.</s> <s i="3342">At this latter stage of the disease, there is little or no insulin secretion, as manifested by low or undetectable levels of plasma C-peptide.</s> <s i="3343">Immune-mediated diabetes commonly occurs in childhood and adolescence, but it can occur at any age, even in the 8th and 9th decades of life.</s>

<s i="3344">Autoimmune destruction of b-cells has multiple genetic predispositions and is also related to environmental factors that are still poorly defined.</s> <s i="3345">Although patients are rarely obese when they present with this type of diabetes, the presence of obesity is not incompatible with the diagnosis.</s> <s i="3346">These patients are also prone to other autoimmune disorders such as Graves’ disease, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, Addison’s disease, vitiligo, celiac sprue, autoimmune hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, and pernicious anemia.</s>

<s i="3347">Idiopathic diabetes.</s> <s i="3348">Some forms of type 1 diabetes have no known etiologies.</s> <s i="3349">Some of these patients have permanent insulinopenia and are prone to ketoacidosis, but have no evidence of autoimmunity.</s> <s i="3350">Although only a minority of patients with type 1 diabetes fall into this category, of those who do, most are of African or Asian ancestry.</s> <s i="3351">Individuals with this form of diabetes suffer from episodic ketoacidosis and exhibit varying degrees of insulin deficiency between episodes.</s> <s i="3352">This form of diabetes is strongly inherited, lacks immunological evidence for b-cell autoimmunity, and is not HLA associated.</s> <s i="3353">An absolute requirement for insulin replacement therapy in affected patients may come and go.</s>

<s i="3354">Type 2 diabetes (ranging from predominantly insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency to predominantly an insulin secretory defect with insulin resistance)

This form of diabetes, which accounts for ~90–95% of those with diabetes, previously referred to as non–insulin-dependent diabetes, type 2 diabetes, or adultonset diabetes, encompasses individuals who have insulin resistance and usually have relative (rather than absolute) insulin deficiency At least initially, and often throughout their lifetime, these individuals do not need insulin treatment to survive.</s> <s i="3355">There are probably many different causes of this form of diabetes.</s> <s i="3356">Although the specific etiologies are not known, autoimmune destruction of b-cells does not occur, and patients do not have any of the other causes of diabetes listed above or below.</s>

<s i="3357">Most patients with this form of diabetes are obese, and obesity itself causes some degree of insulin resistance.</s> <s i="3358">Patients who are not obese by traditional weight criteria may have an increased percentage of body fat distributed predominantly in the abdominal region.</s> <s i="3359">Ketoacidosis seldom occurs spontaneously in this type of diabetes; when seen, it usually arises in association with the stress of another illness such as infection.</s> <s i="3360">This form of diabetes frequently goes undiagnosed for many years because the hyperglycemia develops gradually and at earlier stages is often not severe enough for the patient to notice any of the classic symptoms of diabetes.</s> <s i="3361">Nevertheless, such patients are at increased risk of developing macrovascular and microvascular complications.</s> <s i="3362">Whereas patients with this form of diabetes may have insulin levels that appear normal or elevated, the higher blood glucose levels in these diabetic patients would be expected to result in even higher insulin values had their b-cell function been normal.</s> <s i="3363">Thus, insulin secretion is defective in these patients and insufficient to compensate for insulin resistance.</s> <s i="3364">Insulin resistance may improve with weight reduction and/or pharmacological treatment of hyperglycemia but is seldom restored to normal.</s> <s i="3365">The risk of developing this form of diabetes increases with age, obesity, and lack of physical activity.</s> <s i="3366">It occurs more frequently in women with prior GDM and in individuals with hypertension or dyslipidemia, and its frequency varies in different racial/ethnic subgroups.</s> <s i="3367">It is often associated with a strong genetic predisposition, more so than is the autoimmune form of type 1 diabetes.</s> <s i="3368">However, the genetics of this form of diabetes are complex and not fully defined.</s>

<s i="3369">Other  specific  types  of  diabetes 
Genetic  defects  of  the  b-cell.</s>  <s i="3370">Several forms of diabetes are associated with monogenetic defects in b-cell function.</s> <s i="3371">These forms of diabetes are frequently characterized by onset of hyperglycemia at an early age (generally before age 25 years).</s> <s i="3372">They are referred to as maturityonset diabetes of the young (MODY) and are characterized by impaired insulin secretion with minimal or no defects in insulin action.</s> <s i="3373">They are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.</s> <s i="3374">Abnormalities at six genetic loci on different chromosomes have been identified to date.</s> <s i="3375">The most common form is associated with mutations on chromosome 12 in a hepatic transcription factor referred to as hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1a.</s> <s i="3376">A  second form is associated with mutations in the glucokinase gene on chromosome 7p and results in a defective glucokinase molecule.</s> <s i="3377">Glucokinase converts glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, the metabolism of which, in turn, stimulates insulin secretion by the b-cell.</s> <s i="3378">Thus, glucokinase serves as the “glucose sensor” for the b-cell.</s> <s i="3379">Because of defects in the glucokinase gene, increased plasma levels of glucose are necessary to elicit normal levels of insulin secretion.</s> <s i="3380">The less common forms result from mutations in other transcription factors, including HNF-4a, HNF-1b, insulin promoter factor (IPF)1, and NeuroD1.</s>

<s i="3381">Diabetes diagnosed in the first 6 months of life has been shown not to be typical autoimmune type 1 diabetes.</s> <s i="3382">This so-called neonatal diabetes can either be transient or permanent.</s> <s i="3383">The most common genetic defect causing transient disease is a defect on ZAC/HYAMI imprinting, whereas permanent neonatal diabetes is most commonly a defect in the gene encoding the Kir6.2 subunit of the b-cell KATP channel.</s> <s i="3384">Diagnosing the latter has implications, since such children can be well managed with sulfonylureas.</s>

<s i="3385">Point mutations in mitochondrial DNA have been found to be associated with diabetes and deafness The most common mutation occurs at position 3,243 in the tRNA leucine gene, leading to an A-to-G transition.</s> <s i="3386">An identical lesion occurs in the MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like syndrome); however, diabetes is not part of this syndrome, suggesting different phenotypic expressions of this genetic lesion.</s>

<s i="3387">Genetic abnormalities that result in the inability to convert proinsulin to insulin have been identified in a few families, and such traits are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.</s> <s i="3388">The resultant glucose intolerance is mild.</s> <s i="3389">Similarly, the production of mutant insulin molecules with resultant impaired receptor binding has also been identified in a few families and is associated with an autosomal inheritance and only mildly impaired or even normal glucose metabolism.</s>

<s i="3390">Genetic defects in insulin action.</s> <s i="3391">There are unusual causes of diabetes that result from genetically determined abnormalities of insulin action.</s> <s i="3392">The metabolic abnormalities associated with mutations of the insulin receptor may range from hyperinsulinemia and modest hyperglycemia to severe diabetes.</s> <s i="3393">Some individuals with these mutations may have acanthosis nigricans.</s> <s i="3394">Women may be virilized and have enlarged, cystic ovaries.</s> <s i="3395">In the past, this syndrome was termed type A insulin resistance.</s> <s i="3396">Leprechaunism and the RabsonMendenhall syndrome are two pediatric syndromes that have mutations in the insulin receptor gene with subsequent alterations in insulin receptor function and extreme insulin resistance.</s> <s i="3397">The former has characteristic facial features and is usually fatal in infancy, while the latter is associated with abnormalities of teeth and nails and pineal gland hyperplasia.</s>

<s i="3398">Alterations in the structure and function of the insulin receptor cannot be demonstrated in patients with insulinresistant lipoatrophic diabetes.</s> <s i="3399">Therefore, it is assumed that the lesion(s) must reside in the postreceptor signal transduction pathways.</s>

<s i="3400">Diseases of the exocrine pancreas.</s> <s i="3401">Any process that diffusely injures the pancreas can cause diabetes.</s> <s i="3402">Acquired processes include pancreatitis, trauma, infection, pancreatectomy, and pancreatic carcinoma.</s> <s i="3403">With the exception of that caused by cancer, damage to the pancreas must be extensive for diabetes to occur; adrenocarcinomas that involve only a small portion of the pancreas have been associated with diabetes.</s> <s i="3404">This implies a mechanism other than simple reduction in b-cell mass.</s> <s i="3405">If extensive enough, cystic fibrosis and hemochromatosis will also damage b-cells and impair insulin secretion. fibrocalculous pancreatopathy may be accompanied by abdominal pain radiating to the back and pancreatic calcifications identified on X-ray examination.</s> <s i="3406">Pancreatic fibrosis and calcium stones in the exocrine ducts have been found at autopsy.</s>

<s i="3407">Endocrinopathies.</s> <s i="3408">Several hormones (e.g., growth hormone, cortisol, glucagon, epinephrine) antagonize insulin action.</s> <s i="3409">Excess amounts of these hormones (e.g., acromegaly, Cushing’s syndrome, glucagonoma, pheochromocytoma, respectively) can cause diabetes.</s> <s i="3410">This generally occurs in individuals with preexisting defects in insulin secretion, and hyperglycemia typically resolves when the hormone excess is resolved.</s>

<s i="3411">Somatostatinomas, and aldosteronoma-induced hypokalemia, can cause diabetes, at least in part, by inhibiting insulin secretion.</s> <s i="3412">Hyperglycemia generally resolves after successful removal of the tumor.</s>

<s i="3413">Drugor chemical-induced diabetes.</s> <s i="3414">Many drugs can impair insulin secretion.</s> <s i="3415">These drugs may not cause diabetes by themselves, but they may precipitate diabetes in individuals with insulin resistance.</s> <s i="3416">In such cases, the classification is unclear because the sequence or relative importance of b-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance is unknown.</s> <s i="3417">Certain toxins such as Vacor (a rat poison) and intravenous pentamidine can permanently destroy pancreatic b-cells.</s> <s i="3418">Such drug reactions fortunately are rare.</s> <s i="3419">There are also many drugs and hormones that can impair insulin action.</s> <s i="3420">Examples include nicotinic acid and glucocorticoids.</s> <s i="3421">Patients receiving a-interferon have been reported to develop diabetes associated with islet cell antibodies and, in certain instances, severe insulin deficiency.</s> <s i="3422">The list shown in Table 1 is not all-inclusive, but reflects the more commonly recognized drug-, hormone-, or toxin-induced forms of diabetes.</s>

<s i="3423">Infections.</s> <s i="3424">Certain viruses have been associated with b-cell destruction.</s> <s i="3425">Diabetes occurs in patients with congenital rubella, although most of these patients have HLA and immune markers characteristic of type 1 diabetes.</s> <s i="3426">In addition, coxsackievirus B, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, and mumps have been implicated in inducing certain cases of the disease.</s>

<s i="3427">Uncommon forms of immune-mediated diabetes.</s> <s i="3428">In this category, there are two known conditions, and others are likely to occur.</s> <s i="3429">The stiff-man syndrome is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system characterized by stiffness of the axial muscles with painful spasms.</s> <s i="3430">Patients usually have high titers of the GAD autoantibodies, and approximately one-third will develop diabetes.</s>

<s i="3431">Anti-insulin receptor antibodies can cause diabetes by binding to the insulin receptor, thereby blocking the binding of insulin to its receptor in target tissues.</s> <s i="3432">However, in some cases, these antibodies can act as an insulin agonist after binding to the receptor and can thereby cause hypoglycemia.</s> <s i="3433">Anti-insulin receptor antibodies are occasionally found in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases.</s> <s i="3434">As in other states of extreme insulin resistance, patients with anti-insulin receptor antibodies often have acanthosis nigricans.</s> <s i="3435">In the past, this syndrome was termed type B insulin resistance.</s> <s i="3436">Other genetic syndromes sometimes associated with diabetes.</s> <s i="3437">Many genetic syndromes are accompanied by an increased incidence of diabetes.</s> <s i="3438">These include the chromosomal abnormalities of Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and Turner syndrome.</s> <s i="3439">Wolfram syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by insulin-deficient diabetes and the absence of b-cells at autopsy.</s> <s i="3440">Additional manifestations include diabetes insipidus, hypogonadism, optic atrophy, and neural deafness.</s> <s i="3441">Other syndromes are listed in Table 1.</s>

<s i="3442">GDM

For many years, GDM has been defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy.</s> <s i="3443">Although most cases resolve with delivery, the definition applied whether or not the condition persisted after pregnancy and did not exclude the possibility that unrecognized glucose intolerance may have antedated or begun concomitantly with the pregnancy.</s> <s i="3444">This definition facilitated a uniform strategy for detection and classification of GDM, but its limitations were recognized for many years.</s> <s i="3445">As the ongoing epidemic of obesity and diabetes has led to more type 2 diabetes in women of childbearing age, the number of pregnant women with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes has increased.</s>

<s i="3517">After deliberations in 2008–2009, the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG), an international consensus group with representatives from multiple obstetrical and diabetes organizations, including the American Diabetes Association (ADA), recommended that high-risk women found to have diabetes at their initial prenatal visit, using standard criteria (Table 3), receive a diagnosis of overt, not gestational, diabetes.</s> <s i="3518">Approximately 7% of all pregnancies (ranging from 1 to 14%, depending on the population studied and the diagnostic tests employed) are complicated by GDM, resulting in more than 200,000 cases annually.</s>

<s i="3519">CATEGORIES OF INCREASED RISK FOR DIABETES
In 1997 and 2003, the Expert Committee on Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus (1,2) recognized an intermediate group of individuals whose glucose levels do not meet criteria for diabetes, yet are higher than those considered normal.</s> <s i="3520">These people were defined as having impaired fasting glucose (IFG) [fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) to 125 mg/dl (6.9 mmol/l)], or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) [2-h values in the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) of 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) to 199 mg/dl (11.0 mmol/l)].</s>

<s i="3521">Individuals with IFG and/or IGT have been referred to as having prediabetes, indicating the relatively high risk for the future development of diabetes.</s> <s i="3522">IFG and IGT should not be viewed as clinical entities in their own right but rather risk factors for diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease.</s> <s i="3523">They can be observed as intermediate stages in any of the disease processes listed in Table 1.</s> <s i="3524">IFG and IGT are associated with obesity (especially abdominal or visceral obesity), dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and/or low HDL cholesterol, and hypertension.</s> <s i="3525">Structured lifestyle intervention, aimed at increasing physical activity and producing 5–10% loss of body weight, and certain pharmacological agents have been demonstrated to prevent or delay the development of diabetes in people with IGT; the potential impact of such interventions to reduce mortality or the incidence of cardiovascular disease has not been demonstrated to date.</s> <s i="3526">It should be noted that the 2003 ADA Expert Committee report reduced the lower FPG cut point to define IFG from 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) to 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l), in part to ensure that prevalence of IFG was similar to that of IGT.</s> <s i="3527">However, the World Health Organization (WHO) and many other diabetes organizations did not adopt this change in the definition of IFG.</s>

<s i="3528">As A1C is used more commonly to diagnose diabetes in individuals with risk factors, it will also identify those at higher risk for developing diabetes in the future.</s> <s i="3529">When recommending the use of the A1C to diagnose diabetes in its 2009 report, the International Expert Committee (3) stressed the continuum of risk for diabetes with all glycemic measures and did not formally identify an equivalent intermediate category for A1C.</s> <s i="3530">The group did note that those with A1C levels above the laboratory “normal” range but below the diagnostic cut point for diabetes (6.0 to <6.5%) are at very high risk of developing diabetes.</s> <s i="3531">Indeed, incidence of diabetes in people with A1C levels in this range is more than 10 times that of people with lower levels (4–7).</s> <s i="3532">However, the 6.0 to <6.5% range fails to identify a substantial number of patients who have IFG and/or IGT.</s> <s i="3533">Prospective studies indicate that people within the A1C range of 5.5– 6.0% have a 5-year cumulative incidence of diabetes that ranges from 12 to 25% (4–7), which is appreciably (threeto eightfold) higher than incidence in the

U.S. population as a whole (8).</s> <s i="3534">Analyses of nationally representative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicate that the A1C value that most accurately identifies people with IFG or IGT falls between 5.5 and 6.0%.</s> <s i="3535">In addition, linear regression analyses of these data indicate that among the nondiabetic adult population, an FPG of 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) corresponds to an A1C of 5.6%, while an FPG of 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) corresponds to an A1C of 5.4% (R.T. Ackerman, personal communication). finally, evidence from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), wherein the mean A1C was 5.9% (SD 0.5%), indicates that preventive interventions are effective in groups of people with A1C levels both below and above 5.9% (9).</s> <s i="3536">For these reasons, the most appropriate A1C level above which to initiate preventive interventions is likely to be somewhere in the range of 5.5–6%.</s>

<s i="3537">As was the case with FPG and 2-h PG, defining a lower limit of an intermediate category of A1C is somewhat arbitrary, as the risk of diabetes with any measure or surrogate of glycemia is a continuum, extending well into the normal ranges.</s> <s i="3538">To maximize equity and efficiency of preventive interventions, such an A1C cut point should balance the costs of “false negatives” (failing to identify those who are going to develop diabetes) against the costs of “false positives” (falsely identifying and then spending intervention resources on those who were not going to develop diabetes anyway).</s>

<s i="3539">As is the case with the glucose measures, several prospective studies that used A1C to predict the progression to diabetes demonstrated a strong, continuous association between A1C and subsequent diabetes.</s> <s i="3540">In a systematic review of 44,203 individuals from 16 cohort studies with a follow-up interval averaging 5.6 years (range 2.8–12 years), those with an A1C between 5.5 and 6.0% had a substantially increased risk of diabetes with 5-year incidences ranging from 9 to 25%.</s> <s i="3541">An A1C range of 6.0–6.5% had a 5-year risk of developing diabetes between 25 and 50% and relative risk 20 times higher compared with an A1C of 5.0% (10).</s> <s i="3542">In a community-based study of black and white adults without diabetes, baseline A1C was a stronger predictor of subsequent diabetes and cardiovascular events than was fasting glucose (11).</s> <s i="3543">Other analyses suggest that an A1C of 5.7% is associated with similar diabetes risk to the high-risk participants in the DPP (12).</s> <s i="3544">Hence, it is reasonable to consider an A1C range of 5.7–6.4% as identifying individuals with high risk for future diabetes, to whom the term prediabetes may be applied.</s>

<s i="3545">Individuals with an A1C of 5.7–6.4% should be informed of their increased risk for diabetes as well as cardiovascular disease and counseled about effective strategies, such as weight loss and physical activity, to lower their risks.</s> <s i="3546">As with glucose measurements, the continuum of risk is curvilinear, so that as A1C rises, the risk of  diabetes  rises  disproportionately.</s>

<s i="3547">Accordingly, interventions should be most intensive and follow-up should be particularly vigilant for those with A1C levels above 6.0%, who should be considered to be at very high risk.</s> <s i="3548">However, just as an individual with a fasting glucose of 98 mg/dl (5.4 mmol/l) may not be at negligible risk for diabetes, individuals with A1C levels below 5.7% may still be at risk, depending on level of A1C and presence of other risk factors, such as obesity and family history.</s>

<s i="3549">Table 2 summarizes the categories of increased risk for diabetes.</s> <s i="3550">Evaluation of patients at risk should incorporate a global risk factor assessment for both diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</s> <s i="3551">Screening for and counseling about risk of diabetes should always be in the pragmatic context of the patient’s comorbidities, life expectancy, personal capacity to engage in lifestyle change, and overall health goals.</s>

For decades, the diagnosis of diabetes has been based on glucose criteria, either the FPG or the 75-g OGTT.</s> <s i="3553">In 1997, the first Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus revised the diagnostic criteria, using the observed association between FPG levels and presence of retinopathy as the key factor with which to identify threshold glucose level.</s> <s i="3554">The Committee examined data from three cross-sectional epidemiologic studies that assessed retinopathy with fundus photography or direct ophthalmoscopy and measured glycemia as FPG, 2-h PG, and A1C.</s> <s i="3555">These studies demonstrated glycemic levels below which there was little prevalent retinopathy and above which the prevalence of retinopathy increased in an apparently linear fashion.</s> <s i="3556">The deciles of the three measures at which retinopathy began to increase were the same for each measure within each population.</s> <s i="3557">Moreover, the glycemic values above which retinopathy increased were similar among the populations.</s> <s i="3558">These analyses confirmed the long-standing diagnostic 2-h PG value of >=200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l).</s> <s i="3559">However, the older FPG diagnostic cut point of 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) was noted to identify far fewer individuals with diabetes than the 2-h PG cut point.</s> <s i="3560">The FPG diagnostic cut point was reduced to >=126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l).</s>

<s i="3561">Table 2
Categories of increased risk for diabetes (prediabetes)*

FPG 100 mg/dl (5.6 mmol/l) to 125 mg/dl (6.9 mmol/l) [IFG]

2-h PG in the 75-g OGTT 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) to 199 mg/dl (11.0 mmol/l) [IGT] A1C 5.7–6.4%

*For all three tests, risk is continuous, extending below the lower limit of the range and becoming disproportionately greater at higher ends of the range.</s>



<s i="3562">A1C is  a  widely used  marker  of chronic glycemia, reflecting average blood glucose levels over a 2to 3-month period of time.</s> <s i="3563">The test plays a critical role in the management of the patient with diabetes, since it correlates well with both microvascular and, to a lesser extent, macrovascular complications and is widely used as the standard biomarker for the adequacy of glycemic management.</s> <s i="3564">Prior Expert Committees have not recommended use of the A1C for diagnosis of diabetes, in part due to lack of standardization of the assay.</s> <s i="3565">However, A1C assays are now highly standardized so that their results can be  uniformly applied both temporally and across populations.</s> <s i="3566">In their recent report (3), an International Expert Committee, after an extensive review of both established and emerging epidemiological evidence, recommended the use of the A1C test to diagnose diabetes, with a threshold of >=6.5%, and ADA affirms this decision.</s> <s i="3567">The diagnostic A1C cut point of 6.5% is associated with an inflection point for retinopathy prevalence, as are the diagnostic thresholds for FPG and 2-h PG (3).</s> <s i="3568">The diagnostic test should be performed using a method that is certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) and standardized or traceable to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial reference assay.</s> <s i="3569">Point-of-care A1C assays are not sufficiently accurate at this time to use for diagnostic purposes.</s>

<s i="3570">There is an inherent logic to using a more chronic versus an acute marker of dysglycemia, particularly since the A1C is already widely familiar to clinicians as a marker of glycemic control.</s> <s i="3571">Moreover, the A1C has several advantages to the FPG, including greater convenience, since fasting is not required, evidence to suggest greater preanalytical stability, and less day-to-day perturbations during periods of stress and illness.</s> <s i="3572">These advantages, however, must be balanced by greater cost, the limited availability of A1C testing in certain regions of the developing world, and the incomplete correlation between A1C and average glucose in certain individuals.</s> <s i="3573">In addition, the A1C can be misleading in patients with certain forms of anemia and hemoglobinopathies, which may also have unique ethnic or geographic distributions.</s> <s i="3574">For patients with a hemoglobinopathy but normal red cell turnover, such as sickle cell trait, an A1C assay without interference from abnormal hemoglobins should be used (an updated list is available at http://www.ngsp.org/interf.asp).</s> <s i="3575">For conditions with abnormal red cell turnover, such as anemias from hemolysis and iron deficiency, the diagnosis of diabetes must employ glucose criteria exclusively.</s>

<s i="3576">The established glucose criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes remain valid.</s> <s i="3577">These include the FPG and 2-h PG.</s> <s i="3578">Additionally, patients with severe hyperglycemia such as those who present with severe classic hyperglycemic symptoms or hyperglycemic crisis can continue to be diagnosed when a random (or casual) plasma glucose of >=200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l) is found.</s> <s i="3579">It is likely that in such cases the health care professional would also measure an A1C test as part of the initial assessment of the severity of the diabetes and that it would (in most cases) be above the diagnostic cut point for diabetes.</s> <s i="3580">However, in rapidly evolving diabetes, such as the development of type 1 diabetes in some children, A1C may not be significantly elevated despite frank diabetes.</s>

<s i="3581">Just as there is less than 100% concordance between the FPG and 2-h PG tests, there is not full concordance between A1C and either glucose-based test.</s> <s i="3582">Analyses of NHANES data indicate that, assuming universal screening of the undiagnosed,  the  A1C  cut  point  of >=6.5% identifies one-third fewer cases of undiagnosed diabetes than a fasting glucose cut point of >=126 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l) (www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pubs/ factsheet11/tables1_2.htm).</s> <s i="3583">However, in practice, a large portion of the population with type 2 diabetes remains unaware of their condition.</s> <s i="3584">Thus, it is conceivable that the lower sensitivity of A1C at the designated cut point will be offset by the test’s greater practicality, and that wider application of a more convenient test (A1C) may actually increase the number of diagnoses made.</s>

<s i="3585">Further research is needed to better characterize those patients whose glycemic status might be categorized differently by two different tests (e.g., FPG and A1C), obtained in close temporal approximation.</s> <s i="3586">Such discordance may arise from measurement variability, change over time, or because A1C, FPG, and postchallenge glucose each measure different physiological processes.</s> <s i="3587">In the setting of an elevated A1C but “nondiabetic” FPG, the likelihood of greater postprandial glucose levels or increased glycation rates for a given degree of hyperglycemia may be present.</s> <s i="3588">In the opposite scenario (high FPG yet A1C below the diabetes cut point), augmented hepatic glucose production or reduced glycation rates may be present.</s>

<s i="3589">As with most diagnostic tests, a test result diagnostic of diabetes should be repeated to rule out laboratory error, unless the diagnosis is clear on clinical grounds, such as a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis.</s> <s i="3590">It is preferable that the same test be repeated for confirmation, since there will be a greater likelihood of concurrence in this case.</s> <s i="3591">For example, if the A1C is 7.0% and a repeat result is 6.8%, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed.</s> <s i="3592">However, there are scenarios in which results of two different tests (e.g., FPG and A1C) are available for the same patient.</s> <s i="3593">In this situation, if the two different tests are both above the diagnostic thresholds, the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed.</s>

<s i="3594">On the other hand, when two different tests are available in an individual and the results are discordant, the test whose result is above the diagnostic cut point should be repeated, and the diagnosis is made on the basis of the confirmed test.</s> <s i="3595">That is, if a patient meets the diabetes criterion of the A1C (two results >=6.5%) but not the FPG (,126 mg/dl or 7.0 mmol/l), or vice versa, that person should be considered to have diabetes.</s> <s i="3596">Admittedly,  in  most  circumstance  the “nondiabetic” test is likely to be in a range very close to the threshold that defines diabetes.</s>

<s i="3597">Since there is preanalytic and analytic variability of all the tests, it is also possible that when a test whose result was above the diagnostic threshold is repeated, the second value will be below the diagnostic cut point.</s> <s i="3598">This is least likely for A1C, somewhat more likely for FPG, and most likely for the 2-h PG.</s> <s i="3599">Barring a laboratory error, such patients are likely to have test results near the margins of the threshold for a diagnosis.</s> <s i="3600">The healthcare professional might opt to follow the patient closely and repeat the testing in 3–6 months.</s>

<s i="3601">The decision about which test to use to assess a specific patient for diabetes should be at the discretion of the health care professional, taking into account the availability and practicality of testing an individual patient or groups of patients.</s> <s i="3602">Perhaps more important than which diagnostic test is used, is that the testing for diabetes be performed when indicated.</s> <s i="3603">There is discouraging evidence indicating that many at-risk patients still do not receive adequate testing and counseling for this increasingly common disease, or for its frequently accompanying cardiovascular risk factors.</s> <s i="3604">The current diagnostic criteria for diabetes are summarized in Table 3.</s>



<s i="3605">Diagnosis of GDM

GDM carries risks for the mother and neonate.</s> <s i="3606">The Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes (HAPO) study (13), a large-scale (;25,000 pregnant women) multinational epidemiologic study, demonstrated that risk of adverse maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes continuously increased as a function of maternal glycemia at 24–28 weeks, even within ranges previously considered normal for pregnancy.</s> <s i="3607">For most complications, there was no threshold for risk.</s> <s i="3608">These results have led to careful reconsideration of the diagnostic criteria for GDM.</s> <s i="3609">After deliberations in 2008–2009, the IADPSG, an international consensus group with representatives from multiple obstetrical and diabetes organizations, including ADA, developed revised recommendations for diagnosing GDM.</s> <s i="3610">The group recommended that all women not known to have diabetes undergo a 75-g OGTT at 24–28 weeks of gestation.</s> <s i="3611">Additionally, the group developed diagnostic cut points for the fasting, 1-h, and 2-h plasma glucose measurements that conveyed an odds ratio for adverse outcomes of at least 1.75 compared with women with mean glucose levels in the HAPO study.</s> <s i="3612">Current screening and diagnostic strategies, based on the IADPSG statement (14), are outlined in Table 4.</s>

<s i="3613">These new criteria will significantly increase the prevalence of GDM, primarily because only one abnormal value, not two, is sufficient to make the diagnosis.</s> <s i="3614">The ADA recognizes the anticipated significant increase in the incidence of GDM to be diagnosed by these criteria and is sensitive to concerns about the “medicalization” of pregnancies previously categorized as normal.</s> <s i="3615">These diagnostic criteria changes are being made in the context of worrisome worldwide increases in obesity and diabetes rates, with the intent of optimizing gestational outcomes for women and their babies.</s>

<s i="3616">Table 3

c 1 h: >=180 mg/dl (10.0 mmol/l)

c 2 h: >=153 mg/dl (8.5 mmol/l)

Admittedly, there are few data from randomized clinical trials regarding therapeutic interventions in women who will now be diagnosed with GDM based on only one blood glucose value above the specified cut points (in contrast to the older criteria that stipulated at least two abnormal values).</s> <s i="3624">Expected benefits to their pregnancies and offspring is inferred from intervention trials that focused on women with more mild hyperglycemia than identified using older GDM diagnostic criteria and that found modest benefits (15,16).</s> <s i="3625">The frequency of their follow-up and blood glucose monitoring is not yet clear but likely to be less intensive than women diagnosed by the older criteria.</s> <s i="3626">Additional well-designed clinical studies are needed to determine the optimal intensity of monitoring and treatment of women with GDM diagnosed by the new criteria (that would not have met the prior definition of GDM).</s> <s i="3627">It is important to note that 80–90% of women in both of the mild GDM studies (whose glucose values overlapped with the thresholds recommended herein) could be managed with lifestyle therapy alone.</s>

Position Statement

Diabetes Care in the School and Day Care Setting

AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION

Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood (1).</s> <s i="3675">There are ~215,000 individuals ,20 years of age with diabetes in the U.S.</s> <s i="3676">(2).</s> <s i="3677">The majority of these young people attend school and/or some type of day care and need knowledgeable staff to provide a safe school environment.</s> <s i="3678">Both parents and the health care team should work together to provide school systems and day care providers with the information necessary to allow children with diabetes to participate fully and safely in the school experience (3,4).</s>

<s i="3679">DIABETES AND THE LAW
Federal laws that protect children with diabetes include Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (5), the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (originally the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975) (6), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (7).</s> <s i="3680">Under these laws, diabetes has been considered to be a disability, and it is illegal for schools and/or day care centers to discriminate against children with disabilities.</s> <s i="3681">In addition, any school that receives federal funding or any facility considered open to the public must reasonably accommodate the special needs of children with diabetes.</s> <s i="3682">Indeed, federal law requires an individualized assessment of any child with diabetes.</s> <s i="3683">The required accommodations should be documented in a written plan developed under the applicable federal law such as a Section 504 Plan or Individualized Education Program (IEP).</s> <s i="3684">The needs of a student with diabetes should be provided for within the child’s usual school setting with as little disruption to the school’s and the child’s routine as possible and allowing the child full participation in all school activities (8,9).</s>

<s i="3685">Despite these protections, children in the school and day care setting still face discrimination.</s> <s i="3686">For example, some day care centers may refuse admission to children with diabetes, and children in the classroom may not be provided the assistance necessary to monitor blood glucose and administer insulin and may be prohibited from eating needed snacks.</s> <s i="3687">The American Diabetes Association works to ensure the safe and fair treatment of children with diabetes in the school and day care setting (10–15) (www.diabetes. org/schooldiscrimination).</s>

<s i="3688">Diabetes care in schools

Appropriate diabetes care in the school and day care setting is necessary for the child’s immediate safety, long-term well-being, and optimal academic performance.</s> <s i="3689">The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial showed a significant link between blood glucose control and later development of diabetes complications, with improved glycemic control decreasing the risk of these complications (16,17).</s> <s i="3690">To achieve glycemic control, a child must check blood glucose frequently, monitor food intake, take medications, and engage in regular physical activity.</s> <s i="3691">Insulin is usually taken in multiple daily injections or through an infusion pump.</s> <s i="3692">Crucial to achieving glycemic control is an understanding of the effects of physical activity, nutrition therapy, and insulin on blood glucose levels.</s>

<s i="3693">To facilitate the appropriate care of the student with diabetes, the school nurse as well as other school and day care personnel must have an  understanding of diabetes and must be trained in its management and in the treatment of diabetes emergencies (3,18,19,20,34,36).</s>

 

<s i="3694">Knowledgeable trained personnel are essential if the student is to avoid the immediate health risks of low blood glucose and to achieve the metabolic control required to decrease risks for later development of diabetes complications (3,20).</s> <s i="3695">Studies have shown that the majority of school personnel have an inadequate understanding of diabetes (21,22).</s> <s i="3696">Consequently, diabetes education must be targeted toward day care providers, teachers, and other school personnel who interact with the child, including school administrators, school nurses, coaches, health aides, bus drivers, secretaries, etc. (3,20).</s> <s i="3697">Current recommendations and up-to-date resources regarding appropriate care for children with diabetes in the school are universally available to all school personnel (3,23).</s>

<s i="3698">The purpose of this position statement is to provide recommendations for the management of children with diabetes in the school and day care setting.</s>

<s i="3699">GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR THE CARE OF THE CHILD IN THE SCHOOL AND DAY CARE SETTING

I.</s>	<s i="3700">Diabetes Medical Management Plan

An individualized Diabetes Medical Management Plan (DMMP) should be developed by the student’s personal diabetes health care team with input from the parent/guardian.</s> <s i="3701">Inherent in this process are delineated responsibilities assumed by all parties, including the parent/guardian, the school personnel, and the student (3,24,25).</s> <s i="3702">These responsibilities are outlined in this position statement.</s> <s i="3703">In addition, the DMMP should be used as the basis for the development of written education plans such as the Section 504 Plan or the IEP.</s> <s i="3704">The DMMP should address the specific needs of the child and provide specific instructions for each of the following:


 



 </s>

<s i="3705">1. Blood glucose monitoring, including the frequency and circumstances requiring blood glucose checks, and use of continuous glucose monitoring if utilized.</s>

<s i="3706">2.</s>	<s i="3707">Insulin administration (if necessary), including doses/injection times prescribed for specific blood glucose values and for carbohydrate intake, the storage of insulin, and, when appropriate, physician authorization of parent/guardian adjustments to insulin dosage.</s>

<s i="3738">6.</s>	<s i="3739">Information about the student’s meal/ snack schedule.</s> <s i="3740">The parent should work with the school during the teacher preparation period before the beginning of the school year or before the student returns to school after diagnosis to coordinate this schedule with that of the other students as closely as possible.</s> <s i="3741">For young children, instructions should be given for when food is provided during school parties and other activities.</s>

<s i="3742">7.</s>	<s i="3743">In most locations, and increasingly, a signed release of confidentiality from the legal guardian will be required so that the health care team can communicate with the school.</s> <s i="3744">Copies should be retained both at the school and in the health care professionals’ offices.</s>

<s i="3803">III.</s>	<s i="3804">Expectations of the student in diabetes care

Children and youth should be allowed to provide their own diabetes care at school to the extent that is appropriate based on the student’s development and his or her experience with diabetes.</s> <s i="3805">The extent of the student’s ability to participate in diabetes care should be agreed upon by the school personnel, the parent/guardian, and the health care team, as necessary.</s> <s i="3806">The ages at which children are able to perform self-care tasks are variable and depend on the individual, and a child’s capabilities and willingness to provide self-care should be respected (18).</s>

<s i="3807">1.</s>	<s i="3808">Toddlers and preschool-aged children: unable to perform diabetes tasks independently and will need an adult to provide all aspects of diabetes care.</s> <s i="3809">Many of these younger children will have difficulty in recognizing hypoglycemia, so it is important that school personnel are able to recognize and provide prompt treatment.</s> <s i="3810">However, children in this age range can usually determine which finger to prick, can choose an injection site, and are generally cooperative.</s>

<s i="3811">2.</s>	<s i="3812">Elementary school–aged children: depending on the length of diagnosis and level of maturity, may be able to perform their own blood glucose checks, but usually will require supervision.</s> <s i="3813">Older elementary school– aged children are generally beginning to self-administer insulin with supervision and understand the effect of insulin, physical activity, and nutrition on blood glucose levels.</s> <s i="3814">Unless the child has hypoglycemic unawareness, he or she should usually be able to let an adult know when experiencing hypoglycemia.</s>

<s i="3815">3.</s>	<s i="3816">Middle school– and high school–aged children: usually able to provide selfcare  depending  on  the  length  of diagnosis and level of maturity but will always need help when experiencing severe hypoglycemia.</s> <s i="3817">Independence in older children should be encouraged to enable the child to make his or her decisions about his or her own care.</s>



<s i="3818">Students’ competence and capability for performing diabetes-related tasks are set out in the DMMP and then adapted to the school setting by the school health team and the parent/guardian.</s> <s i="3819">At all ages, individuals with diabetes may require help to perform a blood glucose check when the blood glucose is low.</s> <s i="3820">In addition, many individuals require a reminder to eat or drink during hypoglycemia and should not be left unsupervised until such treatment has taken place and the blood glucose value has returned to the normal range.</s> <s i="3821">Ultimately, each person with diabetes becomes responsible for all aspects of routine care, and it is important for school personnel to facilitate a student in reaching this goal.</s> <s i="3822">However, regardless of a student’s ability to provide self-care, help will always be needed in the event of a diabetes emergency.</s>

<s i="3823">MONITORING BLOOD GLUCOSE IN THE CLASSROOM
It is best for a student with diabetes to monitor blood glucose levels and respond to the results as quickly and conveniently as possible.</s> <s i="3824">This is important to avoid medical problems being worsened by a delay in monitoring and treatment and to minimize educational problems caused by missing instruction in the classroom.</s> <s i="3825">Accordingly, as stated earlier, a student should be permitted to monitor his or her blood glucose level and take appropriate action to treat hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the classroom or anywhere the student is in conjunction with a school activity, if preferred by the student and indicated in the student’s DMMP (3,24).</s> <s i="3826">However, some students desire privacy for blood glucose monitoring and other diabetes care tasks, and this preference should also be accommodated.</s>

<s i="3827">In summary, with proper planning and the education and training of school personnel, children and youth with diabetes can fully participate in the school experience.</s> <s i="3828">To this end, the family, the health care team, and the school should work together to ensure a safe learning environment.</s>

<s i="3829">APPENDIX

Background information on diabetes for school personnel

Diabetes is a serious, chronic disease that impairs the body’s ability to use food.</s> <s i="3830">Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, helps the body convert food into energy.</s> <s i="3831">In people with diabetes, either the pancreas does not make insulin or the body cannot use insulin properly.</s> <s i="3832">Without insulin, the body’s main energy sourcedglucosedcannot be used as fuel.</s> <s i="3833">Rather, glucose builds up in the blood.</s> <s i="3834">Over many years, high blood glucose levels can cause damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels.</s>

<s i="3835">The majority of school-aged youth with diabetes have type 1 diabetes.</s> <s i="3836">People with type 1 diabetes do not produce insulin and must receive insulin through either injections or an insulin pump.</s> <s i="3837">Insulin taken in this manner does not cure diabetes and may cause the student’s blood glucose level to become dangerously low.</s> <s i="3838">Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, typically afflicting obese adults, has been shown to be increasing in youth.</s> <s i="3839">This may be due to the increase in obesity and decrease in physical activity in young people.</s> <s i="3840">Students with type 2 diabetes may be able to control their disease through diet and exercise alone or may require oral medications and/or insulin injections.</s> <s i="3841">All people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes must carefully balance food, medications, and activity level to keep blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible.</s>

<s i="3842">Low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) is the most common immediate health problem for students with diabetes.</s> <s i="3843">It occurs when the body gets too much insulin, too little food, a delayed meal, or more than the usual amount of exercise.</s> <s i="3844">Symptoms of mild to moderate hypoglycemia include tremors, sweating, lightheadedness, irritability, confusion, and drowsiness.</s> <s i="3845">In younger children other symptoms may include inattention, falling asleep at inappropriate times, unexplained behavior, and temper tantrums.</s> <s i="3846">A student with this degree of hypoglycemia will need to ingest carbohydrates promptly and may require assistance.</s> <s i="3847">Severe hypoglycemia, which is rare, may lead to unconsciousness and convulsions and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly with glucagon as per the student’s DMMP (18,24,29,30,31).</s>

 

<s i="3848">High blood glucose (hyperglycemia) occurs when the body gets too little insulin, too much food, or too little exercise; it may also be caused by stress or an illness such as a cold.</s> <s i="3849">The most common symptoms of hyperglycemia are thirst, frequent urination, and blurry vision.</s> <s i="3850">If untreated over a period of days, hyperglycemia and insufficient insulin can lead to a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is characterized by nausea, vomiting, and a high level of ketones in the blood and urine.</s> <s i="3851">For students using insulin infusion pumps, lack of insulin supply may lead to DKA more rapidly.</s> <s i="3852">DKA can be lifethreatening and thus requires immediate medical attention (32).</s>

Position Statement	





Diabetes and Driving



 



 

AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION

Of the nearly 19 million people in the U.S. with diagnosed diabetes (1), a large percentage will seek or currently hold a license to drive.</s> <s i="3941">For many, a driver’s license is essential to work; taking care of family; securing access to public and private facilities, services, and institutions; interacting with friends; attending classes; and/or performing many other functions of daily life.</s> <s i="3942">Indeed, in many communities and areas of the U.S. the use of an automobile is the only (or the only feasible or affordable) means of transportation available.</s>
<s i="3943">There has been considerable debate whether, and the extent to which, diabetes may be a relevant factor in determining driver ability and eligibility for a license.</s> <s i="3944">This position statement addresses such issues in light of current scientific and medical evidence.</s>

<s i="3945">Sometimes people with a strong interest in road safety, including motor vehicle administrators, pedestrians, drivers, other road users, and employers, associate all diabetes with unsafe driving when in fact most people with diabetes safely operate motor vehicles without creating any meaningful risk of injury to themselves or others.</s> <s i="3946">When legitimate questions arise about the medical fitness of a person with diabetes to drive, an individual assessment of that person’s diabetes managementdwith particular emphasis on demonstrated ability to detect and appropriately treat potential hypoglycemiadis necessary in order to determine any appropriate restrictions.</s> <s i="3947">The diagnosis of diabetes is not sufficient to make any judgments about individual driver capacity.</s>

<s i="3948">This document provides an overview of existing licensing rules for people with diabetes, addresses the factors that impact driving for this population, and identifies general guidelines for assessing driver fitness and determining appropriate licensing restrictions.</s>

 

<s i="3949">LICENSING REQUIREMENTS
People with diabetes are currently subject to a great variety of licensing requirements and restrictions.</s> <s i="3950">These licensing decisions occur at several points and involve different levels and types of review, depending on the type of driving.</s> <s i="3951">Some states and local jurisdictions impose no special requirements for people with diabetes.</s> <s i="3952">Other jurisdictions ask drivers with diabetes various questions about their condition, including their management regimen and whether they have experienced any diabetes-related problems that could affect their ability to safely operate a motor vehicle.</s> <s i="3953">In some instances, answers to these questions result in restrictions being placed on a person’s license, including restrictions on the type of vehicle they may operate and/or where they may operate that vehicle.</s> <s i="3954">In addition, the rules for operating a commercial motor vehicle, and for obtaining related license endorsements (such as rules restricting operation of a school bus or transport of passengers or hazardous materials) are quite different and in many ways more cumbersome for people with diabetes, especially those who use insulin.</s>

<s i="3955">With the exception of commercial driving in interstate commerce (Interstate commercial driving is defined as trade, traffic or transportation in the United States between a place in a state and a place outside of such a state, between two places in a state through another state or a place outside of the United States, or between two places in a state as part of trade, traffic or transportation originating or terminating outside the state or the United States [2]), which is subject to uniform federal regulation, both private and commercial driving are subject to rules determined by individual states.</s> <s i="3956">These rules vary widely, with each state taking its own approach to determining medical fitness to drive and the issuance of licenses.</s> <s i="3957">How diabetes is identified, which people are medically evaluated, and what restrictions are placed on people who have experienced hypoglycemia or other problems related to diabetes all vary from state to state.</s>

 

<s i="3958">States identify drivers with diabetes in a number of ways.</s> <s i="3959">In at least 23 states, drivers are either asked directly if they have diabetes or are otherwise required to self-identify if they have diabetes.</s> <s i="3960">In other states drivers are asked some variation of a question about whether they have a condition that is likely to cause altered perception or loss of consciousness while driving.</s> <s i="3961">In most states, when the answer to either question is yes, the driver is required to submit to a medical evaluation before he or she will be issued a license.</s>



<s i="3962">Medical evaluation

Drivers whose medical conditions can lead to significantly impaired consciousness are evaluated for their fitness to continue to drive.</s> <s i="3963">For people with diabetes, this typically occurs when a person has experienced hypoglycemia (3) behind the wheel, even if this did not result in a motor vehicle accident.</s> <s i="3964">In some states this occurs as a result of a policy to evaluate all people with diabetes, even if there has been no triggering event.</s> <s i="3965">It can also occur when a person experiences severe hypoglycemia while not driving and a physician reports the episode to the licensing authority.</s> <s i="3966">In a handful of states, such reporting by physicians is mandatory.</s> <s i="3967">In most other states physicians are permitted to make reports but are given discretion to determine when such reports are necessary.</s> <s i="3968">Some states specify that physicians may voluntarily report those patients who pose an imminent threat to public safety because they are driving against medical advice.</s> <s i="3969">Physicians and others required to make reports to the licensing authority are usually provided with immunity from civil and criminal actions resulting from the report.</s>

<s i="3970">When licensing  authorities learn that a driver has experienced an episode of hypoglycemia that potentially affected the ability to drive, that driver is referred for a medical evaluation and in many cases will lose driving privileges for a period of time until cleared by the licensing authority.</s> <s i="3971">This period can range from 3 to 6 months or longer.</s> <s i="3972">Some state laws allow for waivers of the rules when the episode is a one-time event not likely to recur, for example because of a change in medication or episodes that occur only during sleep.</s>

<s i="3973">Medical evaluation procedures vary and range from a simple confirmation of the person’s diabetes from a physician to a more elaborate process involving a state medical advisory board, hearings, and presentation and assessment of medical evidence.</s> <s i="3974">Some states convene medical advisory boards with nurses and physicians of different specialties who review and make recommendations concerning the licensing of people with diabetes and other medical conditions.</s> <s i="3975">In other states, licensing decisions are made by administrative staff with little or no medical training and with little or no review by a medical review board or by a physician or physicians with any relevant expertise concerning medical conditions presented by individual applicants.</s>

<s i="3976">The medical evaluation process for commercial drivers occurs at predetermined intervals, typically every 2 years.</s> <s i="3977">Unlike noncommercial licenses, these regular evaluations are not linked to episodes of severe hypoglycemia but are part of an ongoing fitness evaluation for jobs requiring commercial driving.</s> <s i="3978">The federal government has no diabetes-specific restrictions for individuals who manage their disease with diet, exercise, and/or oral medication.</s> <s i="3979">It offers an exemption program for insulin-using interstate commercial drivers and issues medical certificates to qualified drivers.</s> <s i="3980">Factors in the federal commercial driving medical evaluation include a review of diabetes history, medications, hospitalizations, blood glucose history, and tests for various complications and an assessment of driver understanding of diabetes and willingness to monitor their condition.</s>

<s i="3981">SCIENCE OF DIABETES AND DRIVING
Hypoglycemia indicating an impaired ability to drive, retinopathy or cataract formation impairing the vision needed to operate a motor vehicle, and neuropathy affecting the ability to feel foot pedals can each impact driving safety (4).</s> <s i="3982">However, the incidence of these conditions is not sufficiently extensive to justify restriction of driving privileges for all drivers with diabetes.</s> <s i="3983">Driving mishaps related to diabetes are relatively infrequent for most drivers with diabetes and occur at a lower rate than mishaps of many other drivers with conditions that affect driving performance and that are tolerated by society.</s>
<s i="3984">However, just as there are some patients with conditions that increase their risk of incurring driving mishaps, such as unstable coronary heart disease, obstructive sleep apnea, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, or alcohol and substance abuse, there are also some drivers with diabetes that have a higher risk for driving mishaps.</s> <s i="3985">The challenges are to identify highrisk individuals and develop measures to assist them to lower their risk for driving mishaps.</s>



<s i="3986">Understanding the risk of diabetes and driving

In a recent Scottish study, only 62% of health care professionals suggested that insulin-treated drivers should test their blood glucose before driving; 13% of health care professionals thought it safe to drive with blood glucose <72 mg/dL (4 mmol/L), and 8% did not know that impaired awareness of hypoglycemia might be a contraindication to driving (5).</s> <s i="3987">It is important that health care professionals be knowledgeable and take the lead in discussing risk reduction for their patients at risk for hypoglycemia.</s> <s i="3988">In a large international study, nearly half of drivers with type 1 diabetes and three-quarters of those with type 2 diabetes had never discussed driving guidelines with their physician (8).</s>

<s i="3989">A meta-analysis of 15 studies suggested that the relative risk of having a motor vehicle accident for people with diabetes as a whole, i.e., without differentiating those with a significant risk from those with little or no risk, as compared with the general population ranges between 1.126 and 1.19, a 12–19% increased risk (6).</s> <s i="3990">Some published studies indicated that drivers with type 1 diabetes have a slightly higher risk, with a relative risk ratio of ~2 (7,8,9), but this was not confirmed by other studies (10).</s> <s i="3991">Two studies even suggested that there is no increased risk associated with insulin-treated diabetes (11,12), but the methodologies used have been criticized (13).</s>

<s i="3992">This increased risk of collisions must be interpreted in the light of society’s tolerance of other and much higher–risk conditions.</s> <s i="3993">For example, 16-year-old males have 42 times more collisions than 35to 45-year-old women.</s> <s i="3994">If the heaviest car collides with the lightest car, the driver of the latter is 20 times more likely to be killed than the driver of the former.</s> <s i="3995">The most dangerous rural highways are 9.2 times more dangerous than the safest urban highways.</s> <s i="3996">Driving at 1:00 A.M. on Sunday is 142 times more dangerous than driving at 11:00 A.M.</s> <s i="3997">(7).</s> <s i="3998">Drivers with attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder have a relative risk ratio of ~4 (14), whereas those with sleep apnea have a relative risk of ~2.4 (15).</s> <s i="3999">If society tolerates these conditions, it would be unjustified to restrict the driving privileges of an entire class of individuals who are at much lower risk, such as drivers with diabetes.</s>

<s i="4000">The most significant subgroup of persons with diabetes for whom a greater degree of restrictions is often applied is drivers managing their diabetes with insulin.</s> <s i="4001">Yet, when the type of diabetes is controlled for, insulin therapy per se has not been found to be associated with increased driving risk (3,16,17).</s> <s i="4002">While impaired awareness of hypoglycemia has been found to relate to increased incidence of motor vehicle crashes in some studies (12), it has not been found to be a relevant variable in other studies (4,7,23).</s> <s i="4003">The single most significant factor associated with driving collisions for drivers with diabetes appears to be a recent history of severe hypoglycemia, regardless of the type of diabetes or the treatment used (1,3,18–21).</s>

<s i="4004">The American Diabetes Association Workgroup on Hypoglycemia defined severe hypoglycemia as low blood glucose resulting in neuroglycopenia that disrupts cognitive motor function and requires the assistance of another to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions (22).</s> <s i="4005">In a prospective multicenter study of 452 drivers with type 1 diabetes followed monthly for 12 months, 185 participants (41%) reported a total of 503 episodes of moderate hypoglycemia (where the driver could still treat him/herself but could no longer drive safely) and 23 participants (5%) reported 31 episodes of severe hypoglycemia (where the driver was unable to treat him/herself) while driving (21).</s> <s i="4006">Conversely, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) group reported 11 motor vehicle accidents in 714 episodes of severe hypoglycemia, a rate of 1.5% (23).</s>

<s i="4007">The significant impact of moderate hypoglycemia while driving is supported by multiple studies demonstrating that moderate hypoglycemia significantly and consistently impairs driving safety (24–26) and judgment (27,28) as to whether to continue to drive or to self-treat (29,30) under such metabolic conditions.</s> <s i="4008">In one study, 25% of respondents thought it was safe to drive even when blood glucose was ,70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) (31).</s>

<s i="4009">While significant hyperglycemia may impair cognitive, motor, and perceptual functioning (32–35), there is only one report suggesting extreme hyperglycemia can impact driving safety (36).</s> <s i="4010">Thus, efforts to equate hyperglycemia with driving impairment are currently not scientifically justified.</s>

<s i="4011">Individual differences

Eighty percent of episodes of severe hypoglycemia affect about 20% of people with type 1 diabetes (37–39).</s> <s i="4012">Available data suggest that a small subgroup of drivers with type 1 diabetes account for the majority of hypoglycemia-related collisions (9,30,40).</s> <s i="4013">When 452 drivers with type 1 diabetes were followed prospectively for a year, baseline reports of prior episodes of mild symptomatic hypoglycemia while driving or severe hypoglycemia while driving, hypoglycemia-related driving mishaps, or hypoglycemia-related collisions were associated with a higher risk of driving mishaps in the following 12 months by 3, 6, 6, and 20%, respectively.</s> <s i="4014">Risk increased exponentially with additional reported episodes: If individuals had two episodes of severe hypoglycemia in the preceding 12 months their risk increased to 12%, and two collisions in the previous 2 years increased their risk by 40%.</s> <s i="4015">The strongest predictors involved a history of hypoglycemia while driving (21).</s> <s i="4016">Laboratory studies that compared drivers with type 1 diabetes who had no history of hypoglycemia-related driving mishap in the past year to those who had more than one mishap found that those with a history of mishaps: 1) drove significantly worse during progressive mild hypoglycemia (70–50 mg/dL, 3.9–2.8 mmol/L) but drove equally well when blood glucose was normal (euglycemia); 2) had a lower epinephrine response while driving during hypoglycemia, 3) were more insulin sensitive, and 4) demonstrated greater difficulties with working memory and information processing speed during euglycemia and hypoglycemia (24,40,41).</s> <s i="4017">Thus, a history of mishaps should be used as a basis for identifying insulin-managed drivers with elevated risk of future mishaps.</s> <s i="4018">Such individuals are appropriately subjected to additional screening requirements.</s>

<s i="4019">Four studies have demonstrated that Blood Glucose Awareness Training (BGAT) reduces the occurrence of collisions and moving vehicle violations while improving judgment about whether to drive while hypoglycemic (42–45).</s> <s i="4020">BGAT is an 8-week psycho-educational training program designed to assist individuals with type 1 diabetes to better anticipate, prevent, recognize, and treat extreme blood glucose events.</s> <s i="4021">This intervention can be effectively delivered over the internet (46).</s> <s i="4022">Diabetes Driving (diabetesdriving.com), a program funded by the National Institutes of Health, is another internet-based tool to help assess the risk of driving mishaps and assist highrisk drivers to avoid hypoglycemia while driving and to better detect and manage hypoglycemia if it occurs while driving.</s>



<s i="4023">RECOMMENDATIONS



Identifying and evaluating diabetes in drivers

Individuals whose diabetes poses a significantly elevated risk to safe driving must be identified and evaluated prior to getting behind the wheel.</s> <s i="4024">Because people with diabetes are diverse in terms of the nature of their condition, the symptoms they experience, and the measures they take to manage their diabetes, it is important that identification and evaluation processes be appropriate, individualized, and based not solely on a diagnosis of diabetes but rather on concrete evidence of actual risk.</s> <s i="4025">Laws that require all people with diabetes (or all people with insulin-treated diabetes) to be medically evaluated as a condition of licensure are ill advised because they combine people with diabetes into one group rather than identifying those drivers who may be at increased risk due to potential difficulties in avoiding hypoglycemia or the presence of complications.</s> <s i="4026">In addition, the logistics of registering and evaluating millions of people with diabetes who wish to drive presents an enormous administrative and fiscal burden to licensing agencies.</s> <s i="4027">States that require drivers to identify diabetes should limit the identification to reports of diabetesrelated problems.</s>

<s i="4028">To identify potentially at-risk drivers, a short questionnaire can be used to find those drivers who may require further evaluation.</s> <s i="4029">The questionnaire should ask whether the driver has, within the past 12 months, lost consciousness due to hypoglycemia, experienced hypoglycemia that required intervention from another person to treat or that interfered with driving, or experienced hypoglycemia that developed without warning.</s> <s i="4030">The questionnaire should also query about loss of visual acuity or peripheral vision and loss of feeling in the right foot.</s> <s i="4031">Inasmuch as obstructive sleep apnea is more common in people with type 2 diabetes than in the nondiabetic population, patients should be queried about falling asleep during the day.</s> <s i="4032">Any positive answer should trigger an evaluation to determine whether restrictions on the license or mechanical modifications to the vehicle (e.g., hand controls for people with an insensate foot) are necessary to ensure public safety.</s> <s i="4033">It is ill-advised to determine risk for driving mishaps based on a driver’s glycosylated hemoglobin because episodic transitions into hypoglycemia, not average blood glucose, increases risk of driving mishaps.</s>

<s i="4034">Evaluation of drivers with diabetes must include an assessment by the treating physician or another diabetes specialist who can review recent diabetes history and provide to the licensing agency a recommendation about whether the driver has a condition that impairs his or her ability to safely operate a motor vehicle.</s> <s i="4035">The treating physician or another physician who is knowledgeable about diabetes is the best source of information concerning the driver’s diabetes management and history.</s> <s i="4036">The input of such a physician is essential to assess a person’s diabetes management and determine whether operation of a motor vehicle is safe and practicable.</s> <s i="4037">If questions arise concerning the safe driving ability of a person with chronic complications of diabetes (e.g., retinopathy or neuropathy), the individual should be referred to a specialist with expertise in evaluating the diabetes-related problem for specific recommendations.</s>

<s i="4038">Physicians should be requested to provide the following information: 1) whether the driver has had an episode of severe hypoglycemia requiring intervention from another person within the previous 2 years (and when this happened); 2) whether there was an explanation for the hypoglycemia; 3) whether the driver is at increased risk of severe hypoglycemia; 4) whether the driver has the ability to recognize incipient hypoglycemia and knows how to take appropriate corrective action; 5) whether the driver provides evidence of sufficient self-monitoring of blood glucose; 6) whether the driver has any diabetes-related complications affecting safe driving that need further assessment; and 7) whether the driver has a good understanding of diabetes and its treatment, has been educated on the avoidance of hypoglycemia while driving, and is willing to follow a suggested treatment plan.</s>

<s i="4039">When evaluating a driver with a history of severe hypoglycemia, impaired hypoglycemia awareness, or a diabetes-related motor vehicle accident, it is necessary to investigate the reasons for the hypoglycemia and to determine whether it is a function of the driver’s treatment regimen or lifestyle, a psychological reaction to the management of their diabetes, or the normal course of diabetes.</s> <s i="4040">Appropriate clinical interventions should be instituted.</s>



<s i="4041">Licensing decisions following evaluation

Drivers with diabetes should only have a license suspended or restricted if doing so is the only practical way to address an established safety risk.</s> <s i="4042">Licensing decisions should reflect deference to the professional judgment of the evaluating physician with regard to diabetes, while also balancing the licensing agency’s need to keep the roads and the public safe.</s> <s i="4043">States should have medical advisory boards whose role is to assess potential driving risks based on continually updated medical information, to ensure that licensing agency staff is prepared to handle diabetes licensing issues, and to make recommendations relevant to individual drivers.</s> <s i="4044">State medical advisory boards should have representation by health care professionals with expertise in treating diabetes, in addition to the information provided by the driver’s treating physician, prior to making licensing decisions for people with diabetes.</s> <s i="4045">Where the medical advisory board does not have a permanent member with expertise in diabetes, such an expert should be consulted in cases involving restrictions on a driver with diabetes.</s>

<s i="4046">As discussed above, a history of hypoglycemia does not mean an individual cannot be a safe driver.</s> <s i="4047">Rather, when there is evidence of a history of severe hypoglycemia, an appropriate evaluation should be undertaken to determine the cause of the low blood glucose, the circumstances of the episode, whether it was an isolated incident, whether adjustment to the insulin regimen may mitigate the risk, and the likelihood of such an episode recurring.</s> <s i="4048">It is important that licensing decisions take into consideration contributory factors that may mitigate a potential risk, and that licensing agencies do not adopt a “one strike” approach to licensing people with diabetes.</s> <s i="4049">Drivers with diabetes must be individually assessed to determine whether their diabetes poses a safety risk.</s> <s i="4050">The mere fact that a person’s diabetes has come to the attention of the licensing agencydwhether by a report or because of an accidentdshould not itself predetermine a licensing decision.</s>

 

<s i="4051">Generally, severe hypoglycemia that occurs during sleep should not disqualify a person from driving.</s> <s i="4052">Hypoglycemia that occurs while the person is not driving should be examined to determine if it is indicative of a larger problem or an event that is not likely to recur while the person is behind the wheel of a car (e.g., hypoglycemia that occurs during an intense bout of exercise).</s> <s i="4053">Some episodes of severe hypoglycemia can be explained and corrected with the assistance of a diabetes health care professional, e.g., episodes that occur because of a change in medication.</s> <s i="4054">However, recurrent episodes of severe hypoglycemia, defined as two or more episodes in a year, may indicate that a person is not able to safely operate a motor vehicle.</s>

<s i="4055">States whose licensing rules lead to a suspension of a driver’s license following an episode of hypoglycemia should allow for waiver of these rules when the hypoglycemia can be explained and addressed by the treating physician and is not likely to recur.</s> <s i="4056">For example, waivers may be appropriate following hypoglycemia that happens as a result of a change in medication or during or concurrent with illness or pregnancy.</s> <s i="4057">Licensing agencies may request documentation from the physician attesting that the patient meets the conditions for a waiver (which may include, among other requirements, education on diabetes management and avoidance of hypoglycemia).</s>

<s i="4058">Drivers with a suspended license because of factors related to diabetes should be eligible to have their driver’s license reinstated following a sufficient period of time (usually no more than 6 months) upon advice from the treating physician that the driver has made appropriate adjustments and is adhering to a regimen that has resulted in correction of the problems that led to the license suspension.</s> <s i="4059">Following reinstatement of driving privileges, periodic follow-up evaluation is necessary to ensure that the person remains safely able to operate a motor vehicle.</s>

<s i="4060">People who experience progressive impairment of their awareness of hypoglycemia should consult a health care provider to determine whether it is safe to continue driving with proper measures to avoid disruptive hypoglycemia (such as testing blood glucose before driving and at regular intervals in the course of a journey lasting more than 30–60 min).</s> <s i="4061">If the driver is able to make adjustments to improve awareness or prevent disruptive hypoglycemia while driving, there should not be license restrictions.</s> <s i="4062">Continuous glucose monitoring may also be beneficial, particularly when noting the direction of the glucose trend.</s> <s i="4063">If this technology is used, the person using the device needs to appreciate that any action taken (e.g., additional carbohydrate consumption) needs to be based on a blood glucose measurement.</s>

<s i="4064">The determination of which disqualified drivers should be reevaluated and when this should be done should be made on an individual basis considering factors such as the circumstances of the disqualifying event and changes in medication and behavior that have been implemented by the driver.</s> <s i="4065">When an assessment determines that the driver should be evaluated at some point in the future, the driver’s physician should be consulted to determine the length of the reevaluation period.</s> <s i="4066">A driver with diabetes should not be kept in an endless cycle of reevaluation if there is no longer a significantly elevated safety risk.</s>

<s i="4067">The determination of medical fitness to drive should be a clinical one, weighing the various factors noted above.</s> <s i="4068">Decisions about whether licensing restrictions are necessary to ensure safety of the traveling public are ultimately determined by the licensing agency, taking into account the clinical determination of medical fitness.</s>

<s i="4069">Physician reporting

Although the concept behind mandatory physician reporting laws is to keep roads safe by eliminating unacceptable risk from impaired driving, such laws have the unintended consequence of discouraging people with diabetes from discussing their condition frankly with a physician when there is a problem that needs correction due to fear of losing their license.</s> <s i="4070">Patients who are not candid with their physicians are likely to receive inferior treatment and therefore may experience complications that present a driving risk.</s> <s i="4071">In addition to the negative effect that mandatory reporting has on the physician-patient relationship, there is no evidence that mandatory physician reporting reduces the crash rate or improves public safety (47).</s>

<s i="4072">Physicians should be permitted to exercise professional judgment in deciding whether and when to report a patient to the licensing agency for review of driving privileges.</s> <s i="4073">States that allow physicians to make such reports should focus on whether the driver’s mental or physical condition impairs the patient’s ability to exercise safe control over a motor vehicle.</s>

 



 

<s i="4074">Reports based solely on a diagnosis of diabetes, or tied to a characterization that the driver has a condition involving lapses of consciousness, are too broad and do not adequately measure individual risk.</s> <s i="4075">Ultimately, reports must be left to the discretion of the physician, using professional judgment about whether the patient poses a safety risk.</s> <s i="4076">Further, in order to protect the physician-patient relationship and ensure the open and honest communication that ultimately promotes safety, it is important that physicians be immunized from liability, both for making reports and not making reports.</s>

<s i="4077">Patient education and clinical interventions

It is important that health care professionals be knowledgeable and take the lead in discussing risk reduction for their patients at risk for disruptive hypoglycemia.</s> <s i="4078">This starts with health care professionals being conversant with safe practices, particularly for those patients at increased risk for diabetes-related incidents.</s> <s i="4079">Perhaps the most important aspect of encouraging people with diabetes to be safe drivers is for health care professionals who treat diabetic drivers to provide education about driving with diabetes and potential risks associated with patients’ treatment regimens.</s> <s i="4080">When that regimen includes the possibility of hypoglycemia, education should include instruction on avoiding and responding to hypoglycemia, discussion about the patient’s vulnerability for driving mishaps, and ongoing learning to ensure that patients have knowledge of when it is and is not safe for them to drive.</s> <s i="4081">For example, the risks of driving under the influence of alcohol are well known, but the delayed hypoglycemic effects of even moderate alcohol intake are not, and alcohol exacerbates the cognitive impairment associated with hypoglycemia (48).</s> <s i="4082">Inasmuch as hypoglycemia can be mistaken for intoxication, and both increase the risk of motor vehicle accidents, patients should be counseled to test glucose more frequently for several hours after moderate alcohol intake.</s> <s i="4083">When a patient has complications of diabetes, it is important for the physician to discuss with the driver the effect of those complications, if any, on driving ability.</s>
<s i="4084">Physicians and other health care professionals who treat people with diabetes should regularly discuss the risk of driving with low blood glucose with their patients.</s> <s i="4085">Clinical visits should include review of blood glucose logs and questions to the patient about symptoms associated with high or low blood glucose levels and what the patient did to treat those levels.</s> <s i="4086">Allowing health care professionals to exercise professional judgment about the information they learn in these patient conversations will encourage candid sharing of information and lead to improved patient health and road safety.</s>
<s i="4087">Clinical interventions in response to hypoglycemia vary by individual but may include strategies for the frequency and timing of blood glucose monitoring, medication dosage changes, and establishing more conservative glucose targets if there is a  history of severe hypoglycemia.</s> <s i="4088">Certain people who have a history of severe hypoglycemia may be encouraged by their health care provider to use continuous glucose monitoring systems that  enable them to detect  a trend toward hypoglycemia before glucose levels fall to a level that will affect safe driving.</s>

<s i="4089">Of note, special care should be taken to prevent hypoglycemia while operating any vehicle in drivers with type 1 diabetes and in those with type 2 diabetes who are at risk for developing hypoglycemia.</s> <s i="4090">They should be instructed to always check blood glucose before getting behind the wheel and at regular intervals while driving for periods of 1 h or greater.</s> <s i="4091">Consideration should be given to factors that may predict a fall in blood glucose, including time of insulin administration, timing of the last meal or food ingestion, and exercise type, duration, intensity, and timing.</s> <s i="4092">Low blood glucose values should be treated immediately and appropriately, and the driver should not drive until blood glucose is in a safely acceptable range, usually after 30–60 min because of delayed recovery of cognitive function.</s>

<s i="4093">People with diabetes who are at risk for disruptive hypoglycemia should be counseled to: 1) always carry a blood glucose meter and appropriate snacks, including a quick-acting source of sugar (such as juice, nondiet soda, hard candy, or dextrose tablets) as well as snacks with complex carbohydrate, fat, and protein (e.g., cheese crackers), in their vehicle; 2) never begin an extended drive with low normal blood glucose (e.g., 70–90 mg/dL) without prophylactic carbohydrate consumption to avoid a fall in blood glucose during the drive; 3) stop the vehicle as soon any of the symptoms of low blood glucose are experienced and measure and treat the blood glucose level; and 4)	not resume driving until their blood glucose and cognition have recovered.</s>

<s i="4094">CONCLUSION
In summary, people with diabetes should be assessed individually, taking into account each individual’s medical history as well as the potential related risks associated with driving.</s>

Position Statement 	
Diabetes Management in Correctional Institutions

AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION

At any given time, over 2 million people are incarcerated in prisons and jails in the U.S (1).</s> <s i="4245">It is estimated that nearly 80,000 of these inmates have diabetes, a prevalence of 4.8% (2).</s> <s i="4246">In addition, many more people pass through the corrections system in a given year.</s> <s i="4247">In 1998 alone, over 11 million people were released from prison to the community (1).</s> <s i="4248">The current estimated prevalence of diabetes in correctional institutions is somewhat lower than the overall U.S. prevalence of diabetes, perhaps because the incarcerated population is younger than the general population.</s> <s i="4249">The prevalence of diabetes and its related comorbidities and complications, however, will continue to increase in the prison population as current sentencing guidelines continue to increase the number of aging prisoners and the incidence of diabetes in young people continues to increase.</s>

<s i="4250">People with diabetes in correctional facilities should receive care that meets national standards.</s> <s i="4251">Correctional institutions have unique circumstances that need to be considered so that all standards of care may be achieved (3).</s> <s i="4252">Correctional institutions should have written policies and procedures for the management of diabetes and for training of medical and correctional staff in diabetes care practices.</s> <s i="4253">These policies must take into consideration issues such as security needs, transfer from one facility to another, and access to medical personnel and equipment, so that all appropriate levels of care are provided.</s> <s i="4254">Ideally, these policies should encourage or at least allow patients to self-manage their diabetes.</s> <s i="4255">Ultimately, diabetes management is dependent upon having access to needed medical personnel and equipment.</s> <s i="4256">Ongoing diabetes therapy is important in order to reduce the risk of later complications, including cardiovascular events, visual loss, renal failure, and amputation.</s> <s i="4257">Early identification and intervention for people with diabetes is also likely to reduce short-term risks for acute complications requiring transfer out of the facility, thus improving security.</s>

<s i="4258">This document provides a general set of guidelines for diabetes care in correctional institutions.</s> <s i="4259">It is not designed to be a diabetes management manual.</s> <s i="4260">More detailed information on the management of diabetes and related disorders can be found in the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Clinical Practice Recommendations, published each year in January as the first supplement to Diabetes Care, as well as the “Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes” (4) contained therein.</s> <s i="4261">This discussion will focus on those areas where the care of people with diabetes in correctional facilities may differ, and specific recommendations are made at the end of each section.</s>



<s i="4262">INTAKE MEDICAL ASSESSMENT



Reception screening

Reception screening should emphasize patient safety.</s> <s i="4263">In particular, rapid identification of all insulin-treated persons with diabetes is essential in order to identify those at highest risk for hypoand hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).</s> <s i="4264">All insulin-treated patients should have a capillary blood glucose (CBG) determination within 1–2 h of arrival.</s> <s i="4265">Signs and symptoms of hypoor hyperglycemia can often be confused with intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol.</s> <s i="4266">Individuals with diabetes exhibiting signs and symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, particularly altered mental status, agitation, combativeness, and diaphoresis, should have finger-stick blood glucose levels measured immediately.</s>



<s i="4267">Intake screening

Patients with a diagnosis of diabetes should have a complete medical history and physical examination by a licensed health care provider with prescriptive authority in a timely manner.</s> <s i="4268">If one is not available on site, one should be consulted by those performing reception screening.</s> <s i="4269">The purposes of this history and physical examination are to determine the type of diabetes, current therapy, alcohol use, and behavioral health issues, as well as to screen for the presence of diabetes-related complications.</s> <s i="4270">The evaluation should review the previous treatment and the past history of both glycemic control and diabetes complications.</s> <s i="4271">It is essential that medication and medical nutrition therapy (MNT) be continued without interruption upon entry into the correctional system, as a hiatus in either medication or appropriate nutrition may lead to either severe hypoor hyperglycemia that can rapidly progress to irreversible complications, even death.</s>



<s i="4272">Intake physical examination and laboratory

All potential elements of the initial medical evaluation are included in Table 7 of the ADA’s “Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes,” referred to hereafter as the “Standards of Care” (4).</s> <s i="4273">The essential components of the initial history and physical examination are detailed in fig.</s>

<s i="4274">1. Referrals should be made immediately if the patient with diabetes is pregnant.</s>

<s i="4275">Recommendations

c Patients with a diagnosis of diabetes should have a complete medical history and undergo an intake physical examination by a licensed health professional in a timely manner. (E)</s> <s i="4276">

c Insulin-treated patients should have a CBG determination within 1–2 h of arrival. (E)</s> <s i="4277">

c Medications and MNT should be continued without interruption upon entry into the correctional environment. (E)</s> <s i="4278">



SCREENING FOR DIABETES
Consistent with the ADA Standards of Care, patients should be evaluated for diabetes risk factors at the intake physical and at appropriate times thereafter.</s> <s i="4279">Those who are at high risk should be considered for blood glucose screening.</s> <s i="4280">If pregnant, a risk assessment for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) should be undertaken at the first prenatal visit.</s> <s i="4281">Patients with clinical characteristics consistent with a high risk for GDM should undergo glucose testing as soon as possible.</s> <s i="4282">High-risk women not found to have GDM at the initial screening and average-risk women should be tested between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation.</s> <s i="4283">For more detailed information on screening for both type 2 and gestational diabetes, see the ADA Position Statement “Screening for Type 2 Diabetes” (5) and the Standards of Care (4). 

figure 1
Essential components of the initial history and physical examination.</s> <s i="4284">Alb/Cr ratio, albumin-to-creatinine ratio; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase.</s>

<s i="4285">MANAGEMENT PLAN
Glycemic control is fundamental to the management of diabetes.</s> <s i="4286">A management plan to achieve normal or near-normal glycemia with an A1C goal of ,7% should be developed for diabetes management at the time of initial medical evaluation.</s> <s i="4287">Goals should be individualized (4), and less stringent treatment goals may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, patients with limited life expectancies, elderly adults, and individuals with comorbid conditions (4).</s> <s i="4288">This plan should be documented in the patient’s record and communicated to all persons involved in his/her care, including security staff.</s> <s i="4289">Table 1, taken from the ADA Standards of Care, provides a summary of recommendations for setting glycemic control goals for adults with diabetes.</s>

<s i="4290">People with diabetes should ideally receive medical care from a physiciancoordinated team.</s> <s i="4291">Such teams include, but are not limited to, physicians, nurses, dietitians, and mental health professionals with expertise and a special interest in diabetes.</s> <s i="4292">It is essential in this collaborative and integrated team approach that individuals with diabetes assume as active a role in their care as possible.</s> <s i="4293">Diabetes self-management education is an integral component of care.</s> <s i="4294">Patient selfmanagement should be emphasized, and the plan should encourage the involvement of the patient in problem solving as much as possible.</s>

<s i="4295">It is helpful to house insulin-treated patients in a common unit, if this is possible, safe, and consistent with providing access to other programs at the correctional institution.</s> <s i="4296">Common housing not only can facilitate mealtimes and medication administration, but also potentially provides an opportunity for diabetes self-management education to be reinforced by fellow patients.</s>



<s i="4297">NUTRITION AND FOOD SERVICES
Nutrition counseling and menu planning are an integral part of the multidisciplinary approach to diabetes management in correctional facilities.</s> <s i="4298">A combination of education, interdisciplinary communication, and monitoring food intake aids patients in understanding their medical nutritional needs and can facilitate diabetes control during and after incarceration.</s>

<s i="4299">Nutrition  counseling  for  patients with diabetes is considered an essential component of diabetes self-management.</s> <s i="4300">People with diabetes should receive individualized MNT as needed to achieve treatment goals, preferably provided by a registered dietitian familiar with the components of MNT for persons with diabetes.</s>

<s i="4301">Educating the patient, individually or in a group setting, about how carbohydrates and food choices directly affect diabetes control is the first step in facilitating self-management.</s> <s i="4302">This education enables the patient to identify better food selections from those available in the dining hall and commissary.</s> <s i="4303">Such an approach is more realistic in a facility where the patient has the opportunity to make food choices.</s>

<s i="4304">Table 1
Summary of recommendations for glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control for most adults with diabetes

A1C	<7.0%*

Blood pressure	<140/80 mmHg†

Lipids <100 mg/dL
LDL cholesterol (<2.6 mmol/L)‡
 

*More or less stringent glycemic goals may be appropriate for individual patients.</s> <s i="4305">Goals should be individualized based on duration of diabetes, age/life expectancy, comorbid conditions, known CVD or advanced microvascular complications, hypoglycemia unawareness, individual and patient considerations.</s>
<s i="4306">†Based on patient characteristics and response to therapy, lower SBP targets may be appropriate.</s> <s i="4307">‡In individuals with overt CVD, a lower LDL cholesterol goal of <70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L), using a high dose of a statin, is an option.</s>

<s i="4308">The easiest and most cost-effective means to facilitate good outcomes in patients with diabetes is instituting a hearthealthy diet as the master menu (6).</s> <s i="4309">There should be consistent carbohydrate content at each meal, as well as a means to identify the carbohydrate content of each food selection.</s> <s i="4310">Providing carbohydrate content of food selections and/or providing education in assessing carbohydrate content enables patients to meet the requirements of their individual MNT goals.</s> <s i="4311">Commissaries should also help in dietary management by offering healthy choices and listing the carbohydrate content of foods.</s>

<s i="4312">The use of insulin or oral medications may necessitate snacks in order to avoid hypoglycemia.</s> <s i="4313">These snacks are a part of such patients’ medical treatment plans and should be prescribed by medical staff.</s> 
<s i="4314">Timing of meals and snacks must be coordinated with medication administration as needed to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, as discussed more fully in the MEDICATION section of this document.</s> <s i="4315">For further information, see the ADA Position Statement “Nutrition Recommendations and Interventions for Diabetes” (7).</s>



<s i="4316">URGENT AND EMERGENCY ISSUES
All patients must have access to prompt treatment of hypoand hyperglycemia.</s> <s i="4317">Correctional staff should be trained in the recognition and treatment of hypoand hyperglycemia, and appropriate staff should be trained to administer glucagon.</s> <s i="4318">After such emergency care, patients should be referred for appropriate medical care to minimize risk of future decompensation.</s> <s i="4319">Institutions should implement a policy requiring staff to notify a physician of all CBG results outside of a specified range,  as  determined  by  the  treating physician (e.g., ,50 or .350 mg/dL).</s>

 

<s i="4320">Hyperglycemia

Severe hyperglycemia in a person with diabetes may be the result of intercurrent illness, missed or inadequate medication, or corticosteroid therapy.</s> <s i="4321">Correctional institutions should have systems in place to identify and refer to medical staff all patients with consistently elevated blood glucose as well as intercurrent illness.</s>

<s i="4322">The stress of illness in those with type 1 diabetes frequently aggravates glycemic control and necessitates more frequent monitoring of blood glucose (e.g., every 4–6 h).</s> <s i="4323">Marked hyperglycemia requires temporary adjustment of the treatment program and, if accompanied by ketosis, interaction with the diabetes care team.</s> <s i="4324">Adequate fluid and caloric intake must be ensured.</s> <s i="4325">Nausea or vomiting accompanied with hyperglycemia may indicate DKA, a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical care to prevent complications and death.</s> <s i="4326">Correctional institutions should identify patients with type 1 diabetes who are at risk for DKA, particularly those with a prior history of frequent episodes of DKA.</s> <s i="4327">For further information see “Hyperglycemic Crisis in Diabetes” (8).</s>



<s i="4328">Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia is defined as a blood glucose level ,70 mg/dL.</s> <s i="4329">Severe hypoglycemia is a medical emergency defined as hypoglycemia requiring assistance of a third party and is often associated with mental status changes that may include confusion, incoherence, combativeness, somnolence, lethargy, seizures, or coma.</s> <s i="4330">Signs and symptoms of severe hypoglycemia can be confused with intoxication or withdrawal.</s> <s i="4331">Individuals with diabetes exhibiting signs and symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia, particularly altered mental status, agitation, and diaphoresis, should have their CBG levels checked immediately.</s>

<s i="4332">Security staff who supervise patients at risk for hypoglycemia (i.e., those on insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents) should be educated in the emergency response protocol for recognition and treatment of hypoglycemia.</s> <s i="4333">Every attempt should be made to document CBG before treatment.</s> <s i="4334">Patients must have immediate access to glucose tablets or other glucosecontaining foods.</s> <s i="4335">Hypoglycemia can generally be treated by the patient with oral carbohydrates.</s> <s i="4336">If the patient cannot be relied on to keep hypoglycemia treatment on his/her person, staff members should have ready access to glucose tablets or equivalent.</s> <s i="4337">In general, 15–20 g oral glucose will be adequate to treat hypoglycemic events.</s> <s i="4338">CBG and treatment should be repeated at 15-min intervals until blood glucose levels return to normal (>70 mg/ dL).</s>

<s i="4339">Staff should have glucagon for intramuscular injection or glucose for intravenous infusion available to treat severe hypoglycemia without requiring transport of the hypoglycemic patient to an outside facility.</s> <s i="4340">Any episode of severe hypoglycemia or recurrent episodes of mild to moderate hypoglycemia require reevaluation of the diabetes management plan by the medical staff.</s> <s i="4341">In certain cases of unexplained or recurrent severe hypoglycemia, it may be appropriate to admit the patient to the medical unit for observation and stabilization of diabetes management.</s>

<s i="4342">Correctional institutions should have systems in place to identify the patients at greater risk for hypoglycemia (i.e., those on insulin or sulfonylurea therapy) and to ensure the early detection and treatment of hypoglycemia.</s> <s i="4343">If possible, patients at greater risk of severe hypoglycemia (e.g., those with a prior episode of severe hypoglycemia) may be housed in units closer to the medical unit in order to minimize delay in treatment.</s>



<s i="4344">Recommendations

c Train correctional staff in the recognition, treatment, and appropriate referral for hypoand hyperglycemia. (E)</s> <s i="4345">

c Train appropriate staff to administer glucagon. (E)</s> <s i="4346">

c Train staff to recognize symptoms and signs of serious metabolic decompensation, and immediately refer the patient for appropriate medical care. (E)</s> <s i="4347">

c Institutions should implement a policy requiring staff to notify a physician of all CBG results outside of a specified range, as determined by the treating physician (e.g., <50 or >350 mg/dL). (E)</s> <s i="4348">

c Identify patients with type 1 diabetes who are at high risk for DKA. (E)</s> <s i="4349">



MEDICATION
Formularies should provide access to usual and customary oral medications and insulins necessary to treat diabetes and related conditions.</s> <s i="4350">While not every brand name of insulin and oral medication needs to be available, individual patient care requires access to short-, medium-, and long-acting insulins and the various classes of oral medications (e.g., insulin secretagogues, biguanides, a-glucosidase inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones) necessary for current diabetes  management.</s>

<s i="4351">Patients at all levels of custody should have access to medication at dosing frequencies that are consistent with their treatment plan and medical direction.</s> <s i="4352">If feasible and consistent with security concerns, patients on multiple doses of shortacting oral medications should be placed in a “keep on person” program.</s> <s i="4353">In other situations, patients should be permitted to self-inject insulin when consistent with security needs.</s> <s i="4354">Medical department nurses should determine whether patients have the necessary skill and responsible behavior to be allowed self-administration and the degree of supervision necessary.</s> <s i="4355">When needed, this skill should be a part of patient education.</s> <s i="4356">Reasonable syringe control systems should be established.</s>

<s i="4357">In the past, the recommendation that regular insulin be injected 30–45 min before meals presented a significant problem when “lock downs” or other disruptions to the normal schedule of meals and medications occurred.</s> <s i="4358">The use of multiple-dose insulin regimens using rapid-acting analogs can decrease the disruption caused by such changes in schedule.</s> <s i="4359">Correctional institutions should have systems in place to ensure that rapid-acting insulin analogs and oral agents are given immediately before meals if this is part of the patient’s medical plan.</s> <s i="4360">It should be noted however that even modest delays in meal consumption with these agents can be associated with hypoglycemia.</s> <s i="4361">If consistent access to food within 10 min cannot be ensured, rapidacting insulin analogs and oral agents are approved for administration during or immediately after meals.</s> <s i="4362">Should circumstances arise that delay patient access to regular meals following medication administration, policies and procedures must be implemented to ensure the patient receives appropriate nutrition to prevent hypoglycemia.</s>

<s i="4363">Both continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and multiple daily insulin injection therapy (consisting of three or more injections a day) can be effective means of implementing intensive diabetes management with the goal of achieving near-normal levels of blood glucose (9).</s> <s i="4364">While the use of these modalities may be difficult in correctional institutions, every effort should be made to continue multiple daily insulin injection or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in people who were using this therapy before incarceration or to institute these therapies as indicated in order to achieve blood glucose targets.</s>

<s i="4365">It is essential that transport of patients from jails or prisons to off-site appointments, such as medical visits or court appearances, does not cause significant disruption in medication or meal timing.</s> <s i="4366">Correctional institutions and police lockups should implement policies and procedures to diminish the risk of hypoand hyperglycemia by, for example, providing carry-along meals and medication for patients traveling to off-site appointments or changing the insulin regimen for that day.</s> <s i="4367">The availability of prefilled insulin “pens” provides an alternative for off-site insulin delivery.</s>



<s i="4368">Recommendations

c Formularies should provide access to usual and customary oral medications and insulins to treat diabetes and related conditions. (E)</s> <s i="4369">

c Patients should have access to medication at dosing frequencies that are consistent with their treatment plan and medical direction. (E)</s> <s i="4370">

c Correctional institutions and police lock-ups should implement policies and procedures to diminish the risk of hypoand hyperglycemia during offsite travel (e.g., court appearances). (E)</s> <s i="4371">

All   patients with a diagnosis of diabetes should receive routine screening for diabetes-related complications, as detailed in the ADA Standards of Care (4).</s> <s i="4372">Interval chronic disease clinics for persons with diabetes provide an efficient mechanism to monitor patients for complications of diabetes.</s> <s i="4373">In this way, appropriate referrals to consultant specialists, such as optometrists/ ophthalmologists, nephrologists, and cardiologists, can be made on an as-needed basis and interval laboratory testing can be done.</s>

<s i="4374">The following complications should be considered:

c Foot care: Recommendations for foot care for patients with diabetes and no history of an open foot lesion are described in the ADA Standards of Care.</s> <s i="4375">A comprehensive foot examination is recommended annually for all patients with diabetes to identify risk factors predictive of ulcers and amputations.</s> <s i="4376">Persons with an insensate foot, an open foot lesion, or a history of such a lesion should be referred for evaluation by an appropriate licensed health professional (e.g., podiatrist or vascular surgeon).</s> <s i="4377">Special shoes should be provided as recommended by licensed health professionals to aid healing of foot lesions and to prevent development of new lesions.</s>

<s i="4378">• Retinopathy: Annual retinal examinations by a licensed eye care professional should be performed for all patients with diabetes, as recommended in the ADA Standards of Care.</s> <s i="4379">Visual changes that cannot be accounted for by acute changes in glycemic control require prompt evaluation by an eye care professional.</s>

<s i="4380">• Nephropathy: An annual spot urine test for determination of microalbuminto-creatinine ratio should be performed.</s> <s i="4381">The use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers is recommended for all patients with albuminuria.</s> <s i="4382">Blood pressure should be controlled to <140/ 80 mmHg.</s>

<s i="4383">• Cardiac: People with type 2 diabetes are at a particularly high risk of coronary artery disease.</s> <s i="4384">Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor management is of demonstrated benefit in reducing this complication in patients with diabetes.</s> <s i="4385">Blood pressure should be measured at every routine diabetes visit.</s> <s i="4386">In adult patients, test for lipid disorders at least annually and as needed to achieve goals with treatment.</s> <s i="4387">Use aspirin therapy (75–162 mg/day) in all adult patients with diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors or known macrovascular disease.</s> <s i="4388">Current national standards for adults with diabetes call for treatment of lipids to goals of LDL <= 100, HDL>40, triglycerides <150 mg/dL, and blood pressure to a level of <140/80 mmHg.</s>

<s i="4389">MONITORING/TESTS OF GLYCEMIA
Monitoring of CBG is a strategy that allows caregivers and people with diabetes to evaluate diabetes management regimens.</s> <s i="4390">The frequency of monitoring will vary by patients’ glycemic control and diabetes regimens.</s> <s i="4391">Patients with type 1 diabetes are at risk for hypoglycemia and should have their CBG monitored three or more times daily.</s> <s i="4392">Patients with type 2 diabetes on insulin need to monitor at least once daily and more frequently based on their medical plan.</s> <s i="4393">Patients treated with oral agents should have CBG monitored with sufficient frequency to facilitate the goals of glycemic control, assuming that there is a program for medical review of these data on an ongoing basis to drive changes in medications.</s> <s i="4394">Patients whose diabetes is poorly controlled or whose therapy is changing should have more frequent monitoring.</s> <s i="4395">Unexplained hyperglycemia in a patient with type 1 diabetes may suggest impending DKA, and monitoring of ketones should therefore be performed.</s>

<s i="4396">Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) is a measure of long-term (2to 3-month) glycemic control.</s> <s i="4397">Perform the A1C test at least two times  a year in patients who are meeting treatment goals (and who have stable glycemic control) and quarterly in patients whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting glycemic goals.</s>

<s i="4398">Discrepancies between CBG monitoring results and A1C may indicate a hemoglobinopathy, hemolysis, or need for evaluation of CBG monitoring technique and equipment or initiation of more frequent CBG monitoring to identify when glycemic excursions are occurring and which facet of the diabetes regimen is changing.</s>

<s i="4399">In the correctional setting, policies and procedures need to be developed and implemented regarding CBG monitoring that address the following:



c infection control

c   education of staff and patients

c   proper choice of meter

c disposal of testing lancets •  quality control programs • access to health services

c   size of the blood sample

c patient performance skills

c  documentation and interpretation of test results

c  availability of test results for the health care provider (10)



Recommendations

c In the correctional setting, policies and procedures need to be developed and implemented to enable CBG monitoring to occur at the frequency necessitated by the individual patient’s glycemic control and diabetes regimen. (E)</s> <s i="4400">

c   A1C  should  be  checked  every  3–6 months. (E)</s> <s i="4401">



SELF-MANAGEMENT EDUCATION
Self-management education is the cornerstone of treatment for all people with diabetes.</s> <s i="4402">The health staff must advocate for patients to participate in self-management as much as possible.</s> <s i="4403">Individuals with diabetes who learn self-management skills and make lifestyle changes can more effectively manage their diabetes and avoid or delay complications associated with diabetes.</s> <s i="4404">In the development of a diabetes selfmanagement education program in the correctional environment, the unique circumstances of the patient should be considered while still providing, to the greatest extent possible, the elements of the “National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support” (11).</s> <s i="4405">A staged approach may be used depending on the needs assessment and the length of incarceration.</s> <s i="4406">Table 2 sets out the major components of diabetes self-management education.</s> <s i="4407">Survival skills should be addressed as soon as possible; other aspects of education may be provided as part of an ongoing education program.</s>

<s i="4408">Ideally, self-management education is coordinated by a certified diabetes educator who works with the facility to develop polices, procedures, and protocols to ensure that nationally recognized education guidelines are implemented.</s> <s i="4409">The educator is also able to identify patients who need diabetes self-management education, including an assessment of the patients’ medical, social, and diabetes histories; diabetes knowledge, skills, and behaviors; and readiness to change.</s>





<s i="4410">STAFF EDUCATION
Policies and procedures should be implemented to ensure that the health care staff has adequate knowledge and skills to direct the management and education of persons with diabetes.</s> <s i="4411">The health care staff needs to be involved in the development of the correctional officers’ training program.</s> <s i="4412">The staff education program should be at a lay level.</s> <s i="4413">Training should be offered at least biannually, and the curriculum should cover the following:



c  what diabetes is

c signs and symptoms of diabetes

c  risk factors

c  signs and symptoms of, and emergency response to, hypoand hyperglycemia

c glucose monitoring

c medications

c exercise

c   nutrition  issues  including  timing  of meals and access to snacks



Recommendations

c   Include diabetes in correctional staff education programs. (E)</s> <s i="4414">



ALCOHOL AND DRUGS
Patients with diabetes who are withdrawing from drugs and alcohol need special consideration.</s> <s i="4415">This issue particularly affects initial police custody and jails.</s> <s i="4416">At an intake facility, proper initial identification and assessment of these patients are critical.</s> <s i="4417">The presence of diabetes may complicate detoxification.</s> <s i="4418">Patients in need of complicated detoxification should be referred to a facility equipped to deal with highrisk detoxification.</s> <s i="4419">Patients with diabetes should be educated in the risks involved with smoking.</s> <s i="4420">All inmates should be advised not to smoke.</s> <s i="4421">Assistance in smoking cessation should be provided as practical.</s>

TRANSFER AND DISCHARGE
Patients in jails may be housed for a short period of time before being transferred or released, and it is not unusual for patients in prison to be transferred within the system several times during their incarceration.</s> <s i="4423">One of the many challenges that health care providers face working in the correctional system is how to best collect and communicate important health care information in a timely manner when a patient is in initial police custody, is jailed short term, or is transferred from facility to facility.</s> <s i="4424">The importance of this communication becomes critical when the patient has a chronic illness such as diabetes.</s>

<s i="4425">Transferring a patient with diabetes from one correctional facility to another requires a coordinated effort.</s> <s i="4426">To facilitate a thorough review of medical information and completion of a transfer summary, it is critical for custody personnel to provide medical staff with sufficient notice before movement of the patient.</s>

<s i="4427">Before the transfer, the health care staff should review the patient’s medical record and complete a medical transfer summary  that includes  the  patient’s current health care issues.</s> <s i="4428">At a minimum, the summary should include the following:

c the patient’s current medication schedule and dosages

c the date and time of the last medication administration

c any recent monitoring results (e.g., CBG and A1C)

c other factors that indicate a need for immediate treatment or management at the receiving facility (e.g., recent episodes of hypoglycemia, history of severe hypoglycemia or frequent DKA, concurrent illnesses, presence of diabetes complications)

c information on scheduled treatment/ appointments if the receiving facility is responsible for transporting the patient to that appointment

c name and telephone/fax number of a contact person at the transferring facility who can provide additional information, if needed



The medical transfer summary, which acts as a quick medical reference for the receiving facility, should be transferred along with the patient.</s> <s i="4429">To supplement the flow of information and to increase the probability that medications are correctly identified at the receiving institution, sending institutions are encouraged to provide each patient with a medication card to be carried by  the patient that contains information concerning diagnoses, medication names, dosages, and frequency.</s> <s i="4430">Diabetes supplies, including diabetes medication, should accompany the patient.</s>

<s i="4431">The sending facility must be mindful of the transfer time in order to provide the patient with medication and food if needed.</s> <s i="4432">The transfer summary or medical record should be reviewed by a health care provider upon arrival at the receiving institution.</s>

<s i="4433">Planning for patients’ discharge from prisons should include instruction in the long-term complications of diabetes, the necessary lifestyle changes and examinations required to prevent these complications, and, if possible, where patients may obtain regular follow-up medical care.</s> <s i="4434">A quarterly meeting to educate patients with upcoming discharges about community resources can be valuable.</s> <s i="4435">Inviting community agencies to speak at these meetings and/or provide written materials can help strengthen the community link for patients discharging from correctional facilities.</s>

<s i="4436">Discharge planning for the patients with diabetes should begin 1 month before discharge.</s> <s i="4437">During this time, application for appropriate entitlements should be initiated.</s> <s i="4438">Any gaps in the patient’s knowledge of diabetes care need to be identified and addressed.</s> <s i="4439">It is helpful if the patient is given a directory or list of community resources and if an appointment for follow-up care with a community provider is made.</s> <s i="4440">A supply of medication adequate to last until the first postrelease medical appointment should be provided to the patient upon release.</s> <s i="4441">The patient should be provided with a written summary of his/her current health care issues, including medications and doses, recent A1C values, etc.



Recommendations

c For all interinstitutional transfers, complete a medical transfer summary to be transferred with the patient. (E)</s> <s i="4442">

c Diabetes supplies and medication should accompany the patient during transfer. (E)</s> <s i="4443">

c Begin discharge planning with adequate lead time to insure continuity of care and facilitate entry into community diabetes care. (E)</s> <s i="4444">

SHARING OF MEDICAL INFORMATION AND RECORDS
Practical considerations may prohibit obtaining medical records from providers who treated the patient before arrest.</s> <s i="4445">Intake facilities should implement policies that 1) define the circumstances under which prior medical records are obtained (e.g., for patients who have an extensive history of treatment for complications); 2) identify person(s) responsible for contacting the prior provider; and 3) establish procedures for tracking requests.</s>
<s i="4446">Facilities that use outside medical providers should implement policies and procedures for ensuring that key information (e.g., test results, diagnoses, physicians’ orders, appointment dates) is received from the provider and incorporated into the patient’s medical chart after each outside appointment.</s> <s i="4447">The procedure should include, at a minimum, a means to highlight when key information has not been received and designation of a person responsible  for contacting the outside provider for this information.</s>

<s i="4448">All medical charts should contain CBG test results in a specified, readily accessible section and should be reviewed on a regular basis.</s>



<s i="4449">CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH DIABETES
Children and adolescents with diabetes present special problems in disease management, even outside the setting of a correctional institution.</s> <s i="4450">Children and adolescents with diabetes should have initial and follow-up care with physicians who are experienced in their care.</s> <s i="4451">Confinement increases the difficulty in managing diabetes in children and adolescents, as it does in adults with diabetes.</s> <s i="4452">Correctional authorities also have different legal obligations for children and adolescents.</s>



<s i="4453">Nutrition and activity

Growing children and adolescents have greater caloric/nutritional needs than adults.</s> <s i="4454">The provision of an adequate amount of calories and nutrients for adolescents is critical to maintaining good nutritional status.</s> <s i="4455">Physical activity should be provided at the same time each day.</s> <s i="4456">If increased physical activity occurs, additional CBG monitoring is necessary and additional carbohydrate snacks may be required.</s>

<s i="4457">Medical  management  and  follow-up Children and adolescents who are incarcerated for extended periods should have follow-up visits at least every 3 months with individuals who are experienced in the care of children and adolescents with diabetes.</s> <s i="4458">Thyroid function tests and fasting lipid and microalbumin measurements should be performed according to recognized standards for children and adolescents (12) in order to monitor for autoimmune thyroid disease and complications and comorbidities of diabetes.</s>

<s i="4459">Children and adolescents with diabetes exhibiting unusual behavior should have their CBG checked at that time.</s> <s i="4460">Because children and adolescents are reported to have higher rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia (13), consideration should be given regarding the use of episodic overnight blood glucose monitoring in these patients.</s> <s i="4461">In particular, this should be considered in children and adolescents who have recently had their overnight insulin dose changed.</s>


<s i="4462">PREGNANCY
Pregnancy in a woman with diabetes is by definition a high-risk pregnancy.</s> <s i="4463">Every effort should be made to ensure that treatment of the pregnant woman with diabetes meets accepted standards (14,15).</s> <s i="4464">It should be noted that glycemic standards are more stringent, the details of dietary management are more complex and exacting, insulin is the only antidiabetic agent approved for use in pregnancy, and a number of medications used in the management of diabetic comorbidities are known to be teratogenic and must be discontinued in the setting of pregnancy.</s>

<s i="4465">SUMMARY AND KEY POINTS
People with diabetes  should receive care that meets national standards.</s> <s i="4466">Being incarcerated does not change these standards.</s> <s i="4467">Patients must have access to medication and nutrition needed to manage their disease.</s> <s i="4468">In patients who do not meet treatment targets, medical and behavioral plans should be adjusted by health care professionals in collaboration with the prison staff.</s> <s i="4469">It is critical for correctional institutions to identify particularly high-risk patients in need of more intensive evaluation and therapy, including pregnant women, patients with advanced complications, a history of repeated severe hypoglycemia, or recurrent DKA.</s>
<s i="4470">A comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to the care of people with diabetes can be an effective mechanism to improve overall health and delay or prevent the acute and chronic complications of this disease.</s>

Diabetes and Employment

AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION


As of 2010, nearly 26 million Americans have diabetes (1), most of whom are or wish to be participating members of the workforce.</s> <s i="4517">Diabetes usually has no impact on an individual’s ability to do a particular job, and indeed an employer may not even know that a given employee has diabetes.</s> <s i="4518">In 1984, the American Diabetes Association adopted the following position on employment:



Any person with diabetes, whether insulin [treated] or non–insulin [treated], should be eligible for any employment for which he/she is otherwise qualified.</s>



<s i="4519">Questions are sometimes raised by employers about the safety and effectiveness of individuals with diabetes in a given job.</s> <s i="4520">When such questions are legitimately raised, a person  with  diabetes  should be individually assessed to determine whether or not that person can safely and effectively perform the particular duties of the job in question.</s> <s i="4521">This document provides a general set of guidelines for evaluating individuals with diabetes for employment, including how an assessment should be performed and what changes (accommodations) in the workplace may be needed for an individual with diabetes.</s>



<s i="4522">I.</s>	<s i="4523">EVALUATING INDIVIDUALS  WITH DIABETES FOR

EMPLOYMENT
It was once  common practice to restrict individuals with diabetes from certain jobs or classes of employment solely because of the diagnosis of diabetes or the use of insulin, without regard to an individual’s abilities or circumstances.</s> <s i="4524">Such “blanket bans” are medically inappropriate and ignore the many advancements in diabetes management that range from the types of medications used to the tools used to administer them and to monitor blood glucose levels.</s>

<s i="4525">Employment decisions should not be based on generalizations or stereotypes regarding the effects of diabetes.</s> <s i="4526">The impact of diabetes and its management varies widely among individuals.</s> <s i="4527">Therefore, a proper assessment of individual candidates for employment or current employees must take this variability into account.</s>

<s i="4528">In addition, federal and state laws require employers to make decisions that are based on assessment of the circumstances and capabilities of the individual with diabetes for the particular job in question (2,3).</s> <s i="4529">Application of blanket policies to individuals with diabetes results in people with diabetes being denied employment for which they are well qualified and fully capable of performing effectively and safely.</s> <s i="4530">It should be noted that, as a result of amendments to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which became effective on 1 January 2009, all persons with diabetes are considered to have a “disability” within the meaning of that law.</s> <s i="4531">This is because, among other reasons, diabetes constitutes a substantial limitation on endocrine system functioningdthe Act was amended to extend its coverage to persons with a substantial limitation in, among other things, a major bodily function, such as the endocrine system.</s> <s i="4532">Therefore, persons with diabetes are protected from discrimination in employment and other areas.</s> <s i="4533">The amendments overturned a series of Supreme Court decisions that had severely narrowed who was covered by the law and resulted in many people with diabetes and other chronic illnesses being denied protection from discrimination.</s> <s i="4534">This section provides an overview of the factors relevant to a medically appropriate individualized assessment of the candidate or employee with diabetes.</s>

<s i="4535">Role of diabetes health care professionals

When questions arise about the medical fitness of a person with diabetes for a particular job, a health care professional with expertise in treating diabetes should perform an individualized assessment.</s> <s i="4536">The involvement of the diabetes health care professional should occur before any adverse employment decision, such as failure to hire or promote or termination.</s> <s i="4537">A health professional who is familiar with the person with diabetes and who has expertise in treating diabetes is best able to perform such an assessment.</s> <s i="4538">In some situations and in complex cases, an endocrinologist or a physician who specializes in treating diabetes or its complications is the best qualified health professional to assume this responsibility (4).</s> <s i="4539">The individual’s treating physician is generally the health care professional with the best knowledge of an individual’s diabetes.</s> <s i="4540">Thus, even when the employer utilizes its own physician to perform the evaluation, the opinions of the treating physician and other health care professionals with clinical expertise in diabetes should be sought out and carefully considered.</s> <s i="4541">In situations where there is disagreement between the opinion of the employee’s treating physician and that of the employer’s physician, the evaluation should be handed over to an independent health care professional with significant clinical expertise in diabetes.</s>

<s i="4542">Individual assessment

A medical evaluation of an individual with diabetes may occur only in limited circumstances (3).</s> <s i="4543">Employers may not inquire about an individual’s health statusd directly or indirectly and regardless of the type of jobd-before making a job offer, but may require a medical examination or make a medical inquiry once an offer of employment has been extended and before the individual begins the job.</s>

<s i="4544">The job offer may be conditioned on the results of the medical inquiry or examination.</s> <s i="4545">An employer may withdraw an offer from an applicant with diabetes only if it becomes clear that he or she cannot do the essential functions of the job or would pose a direct threat (i.e., a significant risk of substantial harm) to health or safety and such threat could not be eliminated with an accommodation (a workplace change that enables a worker with a disability to safely and effectively perform job duties).</s> <s i="4546">Another situation in which a medical evaluation is permissible is when a problem potentially related to the employee’s diabetes arises on the job and such problem could affect job performance and/or safety.</s> <s i="4547">In this situation, a physician may be asked to evaluate the employee’s fitness to remain on the job and/or his or her ability to safely perform the job.</s>

<s i="4548">Employers also may obtain medical information about an employee when the employee has requested an accomodation and his or her disability or need for accommodation is not obvious.</s> <s i="4549">An employer should not rely on a medical evaluation to deny an employment opportunity to an individual with diabetes unless it is conducted by a health care professional with expertise in diabetes and based on sufficient and appropriate medical data.</s> <s i="4550">The information sought and assessed must be properly limited to data relevant to the individual’s diabetes and job performance (3).</s> <s i="4551">The data needed will vary depending on the type of job and the reason for the evaluation, but an evaluation should never be made based only on one piece of data, such as a single blood glucose result or A1C result.</s> <s i="4552">Since diabetes is a chronic disease in which health status and management requirements naturally change over time, it is inappropriated and medically unnecessarydfor examiners to collect all past laboratory values or information regarding office visits whether or  not related  to  diabetes.</s> <s i="4553">Only medical information relevant to evaluating an individual’s current capacity for safe performance of the particular job at issue should be collected.</s> <s i="4554">For example, in some circumstances a review of an individual’s hypoglycemia history may be relevant to the evaluation and should be collected.</s>

<s i="4555">Information about the individual’s diabetes management (such as the current treatment regimen, medications, and blood glucose logs), job duties, and work environment are all relevant factors to be considered.</s> <s i="4556">Only health care professionals tasked with such evaluations should have access to employee medical information, and this information must be kept separate from personnel records (3).</s>



<s i="4557">Screening guidelines

A number of screening guidelines for evaluating individuals with diabetes in various types of high risk jobs have been developed in recent years.</s> <s i="4558">Examples include the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine’s National Consensus Guideline for the Medical Evaluation of Law Enforcement Officers, the National fire Protection Association’s Standard on Comprehensive Occupational Medical Program for fire Departments, the U.S.</s> <s i="4559">Department of Transportation’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s Diabetes Exemption Program, and the U.S.</s> <s i="4560">Marshall Service and Federal Occupational Health Law Enforcement Program Diabetes Protocol.</s>

<s i="4561">Such guidelines and protocols can be useful tools in making decisions about individual candidates or employees if they are used in an objective way and based on the latest scientific knowledge about diabetes and its management.</s> <s i="4562">These protocols should be regularly reevaluated and updated to reflect changes in diabetes knowledge and evidence and should be developed and reviewed by health care professionals with significant experience in diabetes and its treatment.</s> <s i="4563">Individuals who do not meet the standards set forth in such protocols should be given the opportunity to demonstrate exceptional circumstances that would justify deviating from the guidelines.</s> <s i="4564">Such guidelines or protocols are not absolute criteria but rather the framework for a thorough individualized  assessment.</s>



<s i="4565">Recommendations

c People with diabetes should be individually considered for employment based on the requirements of the specific job and the individual’s medical condition, treatment regimen, and medical history. (E)</s> <s i="4566">

c When questions arise about the medical fitness of a person with diabetes for a particular job, a health care professional with expertise in treating diabetes should perform an individualized assessment; input from the treating physician should always be included. (E)</s> <s i="4567">

II.</s>	<s i="4570">EVALUATING THE SAFETY RISK OF EMPLOYEES WITH

DIABETESdEmployers who deny job opportunities because they perceive all people with diabetes to be a safety risk do so based on misconceptions, misinformation, or a lack of current information about diabetes.</s> <s i="4571">The following guidelines provide information for evaluating an individual with diabetes who works or seeks to work in what may be considered a safetysensitive position.</s>



<s i="4572">Safety concerns

The first step in evaluating safety concerns is to determine whether the concerns are reasonable in light of the job duties the individual must perform.</s> <s i="4573">For most types of employment (such as jobs in an office, retail, or food service environment) there is no reason to believe that the individual’s diabetes will put employees or the public at risk.</s> <s i="4574">In other types of employment (such as jobs where the individual must carry a firearm or operate dangerous machinery) the safety concern is whether the employee will become suddenly disoriented or incapacitated.</s> <s i="4575">Such episodes, which are usually due to severely low blood glucose (hypoglycemia), occur only in people receiving certain treatments such as insulin or secretagogues such as sulfonylureas and even then occur infrequently.</s> <s i="4576">Workplace accommodations can be made that are minimal yet effective in helping the individual to manage his or her diabetes on the job and avoid severe hypoglycemia.</s>



<s i="4577">Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia is defined as a blood glucose level ,70 mg/dL (4,6).</s> <s i="4578">It is a potential side effect of some diabetes treatments, including insulin and sulfonlyureas.</s> <s i="4579">It can usually be effectively self-treated by ingestion of glucose (carbohydrate) and is not often associated with loss of consciousness or a seizure.</s> <s i="4580">Severe hypoglycemia, requiring the assistance of another person, is a medical emergency.</s>

 



 

<s i="4581">Symptoms of severe hypoglycemia may include confusion or, rarely, seizure or loss of consciousness (6).</s> <s i="4582">Most individuals with diabetes never experience an episode of severe hypoglycemia because either they are not on medication that causes it or they recognize the early warning signs and can quickly self-treat the problem by drinking or eating.</s> <s i="4583">Also, with self-monitoring of blood glucose levels, most people with diabetes can manage their condition in such a manner that there is minimal risk of incapacitation from hypoglycemia because mildly low glucose levels can be easily detected and treated (4,7).</s>

<s i="4584">A single episode of severe hypoglycemia should not per se disqualify an individual from employment.</s> <s i="4585">Rather, an appropriate evaluation should be undertaken by a health care professional with expertise in diabetes to determine the cause of the low blood glucose, the circumstances of the episode, whether it was an isolated incident, whether adjustment to the insulin regimen may mitigate this risk, and the likelihood of such an episode happening again.</s> <s i="4586">Some episodes of severe hypoglycemia can be explained and corrected with the assistance of a diabetes health care professional.</s>

<s i="4587">However, recurrent episodes of severe hypoglycemia may indicate that an individual may in fact not be able to safely perform a job, particularly jobs or tasks involving significant risk of harm to employees or the public, especially when these episodes cannot be explained.</s> <s i="4588">The person’s medical history and details of any history of severe hypoglycemia should be examined closely to determine whether it is likely that such episodes will recur on the job.</s> <s i="4589">In all cases, job duties should be carefully examined to determine whether there are ways to minimize the risk of severe hypoglycemia (such as adjustment of the insulin regimen or providing additional breaks to check blood glucose levels).</s>



<s i="4590">Hyperglycemia

In contrast to hypoglycemia, high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) can cause long-term complications over years or decades but does not normally lead to any adverse effect on job performance.</s> <s i="4591">The symptoms of hyperglycemia generally develop over hours or days and do not occur suddenly.</s> <s i="4592">Therefore, hyperglycemia does not pose an immediate risk of sudden incapacitation.</s> <s i="4593">While over years or decades, high blood glucose may cause long-term complications to the nerves (neuropathy), eyes (retinopathy), kidneys (nephropathy), or heart, not all individuals with diabetes develop these long-term complications.</s> <s i="4594">Such complications become relevant in employment decisions only when they are established and interfere with the performance of the actual job being considered.</s> <s i="4595">Evaluations should not be based on speculation as to what might occur in the future.</s> <s i="4596">Job evaluations should take high blood glucose levels into account only if they have already caused long-term complications such as visual impairment that interfere with performance of the specific job.</s>

<s i="4597">Aspects of a safety assessment

When an individual with diabetes is assessed for safety risk there are several aspects that must be considered.</s>

<s i="4598">Blood glucose test results.</s> <s i="4599">A single blood glucose test result only gives information about an individual’s blood glucose level at one particular point in time.</s> <s i="4600">Because blood glucose levels fluctuate throughout the day (this is also true for people without diabetes), one test result is of no use in assessing the overall health of a person with diabetes.</s> <s i="4601">The results of a series of self-monitored blood glucose measurements over a period of time, however, can give valuable information about an individual’s diabetes health.</s> <s i="4602">Blood glucose records should be assessed by a health care professional with expertise in diabetes (7).</s> <s i="4603">History of severe hypoglycemia.</s> <s i="4604">Often, a key factor in assessing employment safety and risk is documentation of incidents of severe hypoglycemia.</s> <s i="4605">An individual who has managed his or her diabetes over an extended period of time without experiencing severe hypoglycemia is unlikely to experience this condition in the future.</s> <s i="4606">Conversely, multiple incidents of severe hypoglycemia may in some situations be disqualifying for high-risk occupations.</s> <s i="4607">However, the circumstances of each incident should be examined, as some incidents can be explained due to changes in insulin dosage, illness, or other factors and thus will be unlikely to recur or have already been addressed by the individual through changes to his or her diabetes treatment regimen or education.</s>

<s i="4608">Hypoglycemia unawareness.</s> <s i="4609">Some individuals over time lose the ability to recognize the early warning signs of hypoglycemia.</s> <s i="4610">These individuals are at increased risk for a sudden episode of severe hypoglycemia.</s> <s i="4611">Some of these individuals may be able to lessen this risk with careful changes to their diabetes management regimen (for example, more frequent blood glucose testing or frequent meals).</s> <s i="4612">Presence of diabetes-related complications.</s> <s i="4613">Chronic complications that may result from long-term diabetes involve the blood vessels and nerves.</s> <s i="4614">These complications may involve nerve (neuropathy), eye (retinopathy), kidney (nephropathy), and heart disease.</s> <s i="4615">In turn, these problems can lead to amputation, blindness or other vision problems, including vision loss, kidney failure, stroke, or heart attack.</s> <s i="4616">As these complications could potentially affect job performance and safety, such complications should be evaluated by a specialist in the specific area related to the complication.</s> <s i="4617">If complications are not present, their possible future development should not be addressed, both because of laws prohibiting such consideration and  because with medical monitoring and therapies, long-term complications can now often be avoided or delayed.</s> <s i="4618">Thus, many people with diabetes never develop any of these complications,  and those that  do generally develop them over a period of years.</s>



<s i="4619">Inappropriate assessments

The following tools and terms do not accurately reflect the current state of diabetes treatment and should be avoided in an assessment of whether an individual with diabetes is able to safely and effectively perform a particular job.</s>

<s i="4620">Urine glucose tests.</s> <s i="4621">Urine glucose results are no longer considered to be an appropriate and accurate methodology for assessing diabetes control (8).</s> <s i="4622">Before the mid-1970s, urine glucose tests were the best available method of monitoring blood glucose levels.</s> <s i="4623">However, the urine test is not a reliable or accurate indicator of blood glucose levels and is a poor measure of the individual’s current health status.</s> <s i="4624">Blood glucose monitoring is a more accurate and timely means to measure glycemic control.</s> <s i="4625">Urine glucose tests should never be used to evaluate the employability of a person with diabetes.</s>

<s i="4626">A1C and estimated average glucose.</s> <s i="4627">Hemoglobin A1C (A1C) test results reflect average glycemia over several months and correlate with mean plasma glucose levels (4).</s> <s i="4628">Estimated average glucose (eAG) is directly related to A1C and also provides an individual with an estimate of average blood glucose over a period of time, but it uses the same values and units that are observed when using a glucose meter or recording a fasting glucose value on a lab report (5).</s> <s i="4629">A1C/eAG values provide health care providers with important information about the effectiveness of an individual’s treatment regimen (4) but are often misused in assessing whether   an   individual   can   safely perform a job.</s> <s i="4630">Because they identify only averages and not whether the person had severe extreme blood glucose readings, A1C/eAG results are of no value in predicting short-term complications of diabetes and thus have no use in evaluating individuals in employment situations.</s>

<s i="4631">The American Diabetes Association recommends that in most patients A1C levels be kept below 7% (4), or eAG below 154 mg/dL.</s> <s i="4632">This recommendation sets a target in order to lessen the chances of long-term complications of high blood glucose levels but does not provide useful information on whether the individual is at significant risk for hypoglycemia or suboptimal job performance and is not a measure of “compliance” with therapy.</s> <s i="4633">An A1C or eAG cut off score is not medically justified in employment evaluations and should never be a determinative factor in employment.</s>

<s i="4634">“Uncontrolled” or “brittle” diabetes.</s> <s i="4635">Sometimes an individual’s diabetes is described as “uncontrolled,” “poorly controlled,” or “brittle.” These terms are not well defined and are not relevant to job evaluations.</s> <s i="4636">As such, giving an opinion on the level of “control” an individual has over diabetes is not the same as assessing whether that individual is qualified to perform a particular job and can do so safely.</s> <s i="4637">Such an individual assessment is the only relevant evaluation.</s>



<s i="4638">Recommendations

c Evaluating the safety risk of employees with diabetes includes determining whether the concerns are reasonable in light of the job duties the individual must perform. (E)</s> <s i="4639">

c Most people with diabetes can manage their condition in such a manner that there is no or minimal risk of incapacitation from hypoglycemia at work. (E)</s> <s i="4640">A single episode of severe hypoglycemia should not per se disqualify an individual from employment, but an individual with recurrent episodes of severe hypoglycemia may be unable to safely perform certain jobs, especially when those episodes cannot be explained.</s> <s i="4641">

c Hyperglycemia does not pose an immediate risk of sudden incapacitation on the job, and long-term complications are relevant in employment decisions only when they are established and interfere with the performance of the actual job being considered. (E)</s> <s i="4642">

c Proper safety assessments should include review of blood glucose test results, history of severe hypoglycemia, presence of hypoglycemia unawareness, and presence of diabetes-related complications and should not include urine glucose or AIC/eAG tests or be based on a general assessment of level of control. (E)</s> <s i="4643">



III.</s>	<s i="4644">ACCOMMODATING EMPLOYEES    WITH DIABETESdIndividuals  with  diabetes may need certain changes or accommodations on the job in order to perform their work responsibilities effectively and safely.</s> <s i="4645">Federal and state laws require the provision of “reasonable accommodations” to help an employee with diabetes to perform the essential functions of the job (3).</s> <s i="4646">Additional laws provide for leave for an employee to deal with his or her medical needs or those of a family member (9).</s> <s i="4647">Although there are some typical accommodations that many people with diabetes use, the need for accommodations must be assessed on an individualized basis (2).</s>



<s i="4648">Accommodating daily diabetes management needs

Many of the accommodations that employees with diabetes need on a day-today basis are those that allow them to manage their diabetes in the workplace as they would elsewhere.</s> <s i="4649">They are usually simple accommodations, can be provided without any cost to the employer, and should cause little or no disruption in the workplace.</s> <s i="4650">Most employers are required to provide accommodations unless those accommodations would create an undue burden (3).</s> <s i="4651">Some accommodations that may be needed include the following.</s>

<s i="4652">Testing blood glucose.</s> <s i="4653">Breaks may be needed to allow an  individual to test blood glucose levels when needed.</s> <s i="4654">Such checks only take minutes to complete.</s> <s i="4655">Some individuals use continuous glucose monitors but will still need an opportunity to check blood glucose with a meter.</s> <s i="4656">Blood glucose can be checked wherever the employee is without putting other employees at risk, and employers should not limit where employees with diabetes are permitted to manage their diabetes.</s> <s i="4657">Some employees may prefer to have a private location for testing or other diabetes care tasks that should be provided whenever feasible.</s>

<s i="4658">Administering insulin.</s> <s i="4659">Employees may need short breaks during the workday to administer insulin when it is  needed.</s> <s i="4660">Insulin can be safely administered wherever the employee happens to be.</s> <s i="4661">The employee may also need a place to store insulin and other supplies if work conditions (such as extreme temperatures) prevent the supplies from being carried on the person (10).</s>

<s i="4662">Food and drink.</s> <s i="4663">Employees may need access to food and/or beverages during the workday.</s> <s i="4664">This is particularly important in the event that the employee needs to quickly respond to low blood glucose levels or maintain hydration if glucose levels are high.</s> <s i="4665">Employees should be permitted to consume food or beverages as needed at their desk or work station (except in an extremely rare situation in which this would pose a hazard and create a safety issue, and if this is the case, an alternative site should be provided).</s>

<s i="4666">Leave.</s> <s i="4667">Employees may need leave or a flexible work schedule to accommodate medical appointments or other diabetes care needs.</s> <s i="4668">Occasionally, employees may need to miss work due to unanticipated events (severe hypoglycemic episode) or illness.</s>

<s i="4669">Work schedules.</s> <s i="4670">Certain types of work schedules, such as rotating or split shifts, can make it especially difficult for some individuals to manage diabetes effectively.</s>



<s i="4671">Accommodating complications of diabetes

In addition to accommodating the day-today management of diabetes in the workplace, for some individuals it is also necessary to seek modifications for longterm diabetes-related complications.</s> <s i="4672">Such people can remain productive employees if appropriate accommodations are implemented.</s>

<s i="4673">For example, an employee with diabetic retinopathy or other vision impairments may benefit from using a big screen computer or other visual aids, while an employee with nerve pain may benefit from reduced walking distances or having the ability to sit down on the job.</s> <s i="4674">Individuals with kidney problems may need to have flexibility to take time off work for dialysis treatment.</s>

<s i="4675">It is impossible to provide an exhaustive list of potential accommodations.</s> <s i="4676">The key message in accommodating an employee with diabetes is to ensure that accommodations are tailored to the individual and effective in helping the individual perform his or her job.</s> <s i="4677">Input from health care professionals who specialize in the particular complication, or from vocational rehabilitation specialists or organizations, may help identify appropriate  accommodations.</s>



<s i="4678">Recommendations

c Individuals with diabetes may need accommodations on the job in order to perform their work responsibilities effectively and safely; these include accommodating daily diabetes needs and, when present, the complications of diabetes. (E)</s> <s i="4679">All such accommodations must be tailored to the individual and effective in helping the individual perform his or her job.</s> <s i="4680">



CONCLUSION-Individuals with diabetes can and do serve as highly productive members of the workforce.</s> <s i="4681">While not every individual with diabetes will be qualified for, nor can perform, every available job, reasonable accommodations can readily be made that allow the vast majority of people with diabetes to effectively perform the vast majority of jobs.</s> <s i="4682">The therapies for, and effects of, diabetes vary greatly from person to person, so employers must consider each person’s capacities and needs on an individual basis.</s>  <s i="4683">People  with diabetes should always be evaluated individually with the assistance of experienced diabetes health care professionals.</s> <s i="4684">The requirements of the specific job and the individual’s ability to perform that job, with or without reasonable accommodations, always need to be considered.</s>

Third-Party Reimbursement for Diabetes Care, Self-Management Education, and Supplies
 

AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION

 Diaiabetes is a chronic disease that affects nearly 26 million Americans(1)	and is characterized by serious, costly, and often fatal complications.</s> <s i="4716">The total cost of diagnosed diabetes in the U.S. in 2007 was estimated to be >=174 billion (2).</s> <s i="4717">To prevent or delay costly diabetes complications and to enable people with diabetes to lead healthy, productive lives, appropriate medical care based on current standards of practice, self-management education, and medication and supplies must be available to everyone with diabetes.</s> <s i="4718">This article is based on technical reviews titled “Diabetes Self-Management Education” (3) and “National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education Programs” (4).</s>

<s i="4719">The goal of medical care for people with diabetes is to optimize glycemic control and minimize complications.</s> <s i="4720">The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) demonstrated that treatment that maintains blood glucose levels near normal in type 1 diabetes delays the onset and reduces the progression of microvascular complications.</s> <s i="4721">The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) documented that optimal glycemic control can also benefit most individuals with type 2 diabetes.</s> <s i="4722">To achieve optimal glucose control, the person with diabetes must be able to access health care providers who have expertise in the field of diabetes.</s> <s i="4723">Treatment plans must also include self-management training and tools, regular and timely laboratory evaluations, medical nutrition therapy, appropriately prescribed medication(s), and regular self-monitoring of blood glucose levels.</s> <s i="4724">The American Diabetes Association position statement “Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes” outlines appropriate medical care for people with diabetes (5).</s>

<s i="4725">An integral component of diabetes care is self-management education (inpatient and/or outpatient) delivered by an interdisciplinary team.</s> <s i="4726">Self-management training helps people with diabetes adjust their daily regimen to improve glycemic control.</s> <s i="4727">Diabetes self-management education teaches individuals with diabetes to assess the interplay among medical nutrition therapy, physical activity, emotional/physical stress, and medications, and then to respond appropriately and continually to those factors to achieve and maintain optimal glucose control.</s>

<s i="4728">Today, self-management education is understood to be such a critical part of diabetes care that medical treatment of diabetes without systematic self-management education is regarded as inadequate.</s> <s i="4729">The National Standards for Diabetes SelfManagement Education and Support establish specific criteria against which diabetes education programs can be measured, and a quality assurance program has been developed and subsequently revised (6).</s>

<s i="4730">Treatments and therapies that improve glycemic control and reduce the complications of diabetes will also significantly reduce health care costs (7,8).</s> <s i="4731">Numerous studies have demonstrated that self-management education leads to reductions in the costs associated with all types of diabetes.</s> <s i="4732">Participants in selfmanagement education programs have been found to have decreased lowerextremity amputation rates, reduced medication costs, and fewer emergency room visits and hospitalizations.</s>

<s i="4733">To achieve optimal glycemic control, thus achieving long-term reduction in health care costs, individuals with diabetes must have access to the integral components of diabetes care, such as health care visits, diabetes supplies, self-management education, and diabetes medications.</s> <s i="4734">As such, insurers must reimburse for diabetes-related medical treatment as well as for self-management education programs that have met accepted standards, such as the American Diabetes Association’s National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support.</s> <s i="4735">Furthermore, third-party payers must also reimburse for medications and supplies related to the daily care of diabetes.</s> <s i="4736">These same standards should also apply to organizations that purchase health care benefits for their members or employees, as well as managed care organizations that provide services to participants.</s>

<s i="4737">It is recognized that the use of formularies, prior authorization, competitive bidding, and related provisions (hereafter referred to as “controls”) can manage provider practices and costs to the potential benefit of payors and patients.</s> <s i="4738">Social Security Act Title XIX, section 1927, states that excluded medications should not have “a significant clinically meaningful therapeutic advantage in terms of safety, effectiveness or clinical outcomes of such treatment of such population.” A variety of laws, regulations, and executive orders also provide guidance on the use of such controls to oversee the purchase and use of durable medical equipment (hereafter referred to as “equipment”) and singleuse medical supplies (hereafter referred to as “supplies”) associated with the management of diabetes.</s>

<s i="4739">Certain principles should guide the creation and enforcement of controls in order to insure that they meet the comprehensive medical needs of people living with diabetes.</s> <s i="4740">A wide array of medications and supplies are correlated with improved glycemic outcomes and a reduction in the risk of diabetes-related complications.</s> <s i="4741">Because no single diabetes treatment regimen is appropriate for all people with diabetes, providers and patients should have access to a broad array of medications and supplies to develop an effective treatment modality.</s>

 



 

<s i="4742">However, the Association also recognizes that there may be a number of medications and/or supplies within any given class.</s> <s i="4743">As such, any controls should ensure that all classes of antidiabetic agents with unique mechanisms of action are available to facilitate achieving glycemic goals to reduce the risk of complications.</s> <s i="4744">Similar issues operate in the management of lipid disorders, hypertension, and other cardiovascular risk factors, as well as for other diabetes complications.</s> <s i="4745">Furthermore, any controls should ensure that all classes of equipment and supplies designed for use with such equipment are available to facilitate achieving glycemic goals to reduce the risk of complications.</s> <s i="4746">It is important to note that medical advances are rapidly changing the landscape of diabetes medications and supplies.</s> <s i="4747">To ensure that patients with diabetes have access to beneficial updates in treatment modalities, systems of controls must employ efficient mechanisms through which to introduce and approve new products.</s>

<s i="4748">Though it can seem appropriate for controls to restrict certain items in chronic disease management, particularly with a complex disorder such as diabetes, it should be recognized that adherence is a major barrier to achieving targets.</s> <s i="4749">Any controls should take into account the huge mental and physical burden that intensive disease management exerts upon patients with diabetes.</s> <s i="4750">Protections should ensure that patients with diabetes can readily comply with therapy in the widely variable circumstances encountered in daily life.</s> <s i="4751">These protections should guarantee access to an acceptable range and all classes of antidiabetic medications, equipment, and supplies.</s> <s i="4752">Furthermore, fair and reasonable appeals processes should ensure that diabetic patients and their medical care practitioners can obtain medications, equipment, and supplies that are not contained within existent controls.</s>

<s i="4753">Diabetes management needs individualization in order for patients to reach glycemic targets.</s> <s i="4754">Because there is diversity in the manifestations of the disease and in the impact of other medical conditions upon diabetes, it is common that practitioners will need to uniquely tailor treatment for their patients.</s> <s i="4755">To reach diabetes treatment  goals,  practitioners  should have access to all classes of antidiabetic medications,  equipment,  and  supplies without undue controls.</s> <s i="4756">Without appropriate safeguards, these controls could constitute an obstruction of effective care.</s> 
<s i="4757">The value of self-management education and provision of diabetes supplies has been acknowledged by the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (9) and by stated medical policy on both diabetes education and medical nutrition therapy.</s>

<s i="4783">Diabetes self-management education (DSME) is a critical element of care for all people with diabetes and those at risk for developing the disease.</s> <s i="4784">It is necessary in order to prevent or delay the complications of diabetes (2–6) and has elements related to lifestyle changes that are also essential for individuals with prediabetes as part of efforts to prevent the disease (7,8).</s>
<s i="4785">The National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education are designed to define quality DSME and support and to assist diabetes educators in providing evidence-based education and selfmanagement support.</s> <s i="4786">The Standards are applicable to educators in solo practice as well as those in large multicenter programsdand everyone in between.</s> <s i="4787">There are many good models for the provision of diabetes education and support.</s> <s i="4788">The Standards do not endorse any one approach, but rather seek to delineate the commonalities among effective and excellent self-management education strategies.</s> <s i="4789">These are the standards used in the field for recognition and accreditation.</s> <s i="4790">They also serve as a guide for non-accredited and nonrecognized providers and programs.</s>
<s i="4791">Because of the dynamic nature of health care and diabetes-related research, the Standards are reviewed and revised approximately every 5 years by key stakeholders and experts within the diabetes education community.</s> <s i="4792">In the fall of 2011, a Task Force was jointly convened by the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA).</s> <s i="4793">Members of the Task Force included experts from the areas of public health, underserved populations including rural primary care and
other rural health services, individual practices, large urban specialty practices, and urban hospitals.</s> <s i="4794">They also included individuals with diabetes, diabetes researchers, certified diabetes educators, registered nurses, registered dietitians, physicians, pharmacists, and a psychologist.</s> <s i="4795">The Task Force was charged with reviewing the current National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education for their appropriateness, relevance, and scientific basis and updating them based on the available evidence and expert consensus.</s>

<s i="4796">The Task Force made the decision to change the name of the Standards from the National Standards for Diabetes SelfManagement Education to the National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support.</s> <s i="4797">This name change is intended to codify the significance of ongoing support for people with diabetes and those at risk for developing the disease, particularly to encourage behavior change, the maintenance of healthy diabetes-related behaviors, and to address psychosocial concerns.</s> <s i="4798">Given that self-management does not stop when a patient leaves the educator’s office, self-management support must be an ongoing process.</s>

<s i="4799">Although the term “diabetes” is used predominantly, the Standards should also be understood to apply to the education and support of people with prediabetes.</s>

<s i="4800">Currently, there are significant barriers to the provision of education and support to those with prediabetes.</s> <s i="4801">And yet, the strategies for supporting successful behavior change and the healthy behaviors recommended for people with prediabetes are largely identical to those for individuals with diabetes.</s> <s i="4802">As barriers to care are overcome, providers of DSME and diabetes self-management support (DSMS), given their training and experience, are particularly well equipped to assist individuals with prediabetes in developing and maintaining behaviors that can prevent or delay the onset of diabetes.</s>

<s i="4803">Many people with diabetes have or are at risk for developing comorbidities, including both diabetes-related complications and conditions (e.g., heart disease, lipid abnormalities, nerve damage, hypertension, and depression) and other medical problems that may interfere with self-care (e.g., emphysema, arthritis, and alcoholism).</s> <s i="4804">In addition, the diagnosis, progression, and daily work of managing the disease can take a major emotional toll on people with diabetes that makes selfcare even more difficult (9).</s> <s i="4805">The Standards encourage providers of DSME and DSMS to address the entire panorama of each participant’s clinical profile.</s> <s i="4806">Regular communication among the members of participant’s health care teams is essential to ensure high-quality, effective education and support for people with diabetes and prediabetes.</s>

<s i="4807">In the course of its work on the Standards, the Task Force identified areas in which there is currently an insufficient amount of research.</s> <s i="4808">In particular, there are three areas in which the Task Force recommends additional research:

</s>

<s i="4809">1. What is the influence of organizational structure on the effectiveness of the provision of DSME and DSMS?</s>

<s i="4810">2.</s>	<s i="4811">What is the impact of using a structured curriculum in DSME?</s>

<s i="4812">3.</s>	<s i="4813">What training should be required for those community, lay, or peer workers without training in health or diabetes who are to participate in the provision of DSME and to provide DSMS?</s>

<s i="4814">Finally, the Standards emphasize that the person with diabetes is at the center of the entire diabetes education and support process.</s> <s i="4815">It is the individuals with diabetes who do the hard work of managing their condition, day in and day out.</s> <s i="4816">The educator’s role, first and foremost, is to make that work easier (10).</s>

<s i="4817">DEfiNITIONS

DSME: The ongoing process of facilitating the knowledge, skill, and ability necessary for prediabetes and diabetes self-care.</s> <s i="4818">This process incorporates the needs, goals, and life experiences of the person with diabetes or prediabetes and is guided by evidence-based standards.</s> <s i="4819">The overall objectives of DSME are to support informed decision making, self-care behaviors, problem solving, and active collaboration with the health care team and to improve clinical outcomes, health status, and quality of life.</s>

<s i="4820">DSMS: Activities that assist the person with prediabetes or diabetes in implementing and  sustaining  the behaviors needed to manage his or her condition on an ongoing basis beyond or outside of formal self-management training.</s> <s i="4821">The type of support provided can be behavioral, educational, psychosocial, or clinical (11–15).</s>



<s i="4822">STANDARD 1



Internal structure

The provider(s) of DSME will document an organizational structure, mission statement, and goals.</s> <s i="4823">For those providers working within a larger organization, that organization will recognize and support quality DSME as an integral component of diabetes care.</s>

<s i="4824">Documentation of an organizational structure, mission statement, and goals can lead to efficient and effective provision of DSME and DSMS.</s> <s i="4825">In the business literature, case studies and case report investigations of successful management strategies emphasize the importance of clear goals and objectives, defined relationships and roles, and managerial support.</s> <s i="4826">Business and health policy experts and organizations emphasize written commitments, policies, support, and the importance of outcomes reporting to maintain ongoing support or commitment (16,17).</s>

<s i="4827">Documentation of an organizational structure that delineates channels of communication and represents institutional commitment to the educational entity is critical for success.</s> <s i="4828">According to The Joint Commission, this type of documentation is equally important for both small and large health care organizations (18).</s> <s i="4829">Health care and business experts overwhelmingly agree that documentation of the process of providing services is a critical factor in clear communication and provides a solid basis from which to deliver quality diabetes education.</s> <s i="4830">In 2010, The Joint Commission published the Disease-Specific Care Certification Manual, which outlines standards and performance measurements for chronic care programs and disease management services, including “Supporting SelfManagement” (18).</s>



<s i="4831">STANDARD 2



External input

The provider(s) of DSME will seek ongoing input from external stakeholders and experts in order to promote program quality.</s>

<s i="4832">For both individual and group providers of DSME and DSMS, external input is vital to maintaining an up-to-date, effective program.</s> <s i="4833">Broad participation of community stakeholders, including individuals with diabetes, health professionals, and community interest groups, will increase the program’s knowledge of the local population and allow the provider to better serve the community.</s> <s i="4834">Often, but not always, this external input is best achieved by the establishment of a formal advisory board.</s> <s i="4835">The DSME and DSMS provider(s) must have a documented plan for seeking outside input and acting on it.</s>

<s i="4836">The goal of external input and discussion in the program planning process is to foster ideas that will enhance the quality of the DSME and/or DSMS being provided, while building bridges to key stakeholders (19).</s> <s i="4837">The result is effective, dynamic DSME that is patient centered, more responsive to consumer-identified needs and the needs of the community, more culturally relevant, and more appealing to consumers (17,19,20).</s>



<s i="4838">STANDARD 3



Access

The provider(s) of DSME will determine who to serve, how best to deliver diabetes education to that population, and what resources can provide ongoing support for that population.</s>

<s i="4839">Currently, the majority  of people with diabetes and prediabetes do not receive any structured diabetes education (19,20).</s> <s i="4840">While there are many barriers to DSME, one crucial issue is access (21).</s> <s i="4841">Providers of DSME can help address this issue by:



c Clarifying the specific population to be served.</s> <s i="4842">Understanding the community, service area, or regional demographics is crucial to ensuring that as many people as possible are being reached, including those who do not frequently attend clinical appointments (9,17,22–24).</s>

<s i="4843">•   Determining that population’s selfmanagement education and support needs.</s> <s i="4844">Different individuals, their families, and communities need different types of education and support (25).</s> <s i="4845">The provider(s) of DSME and DSMS needs to work to ensure that the necessary education alternatives are available (25–27).</s> <s i="4846">This means understanding the population’s demographic characteristics, such as ethnic/ cultural background, sex, and age, as well as levels of formal education, literacy, and numeracy (28–31).</s> <s i="4847">It may also entail identifying resources outside of the provider’s practice that can assist in the ongoing support of the participant.</s>

<s i="4848">• Identifying access issues and working to overcome them.</s> <s i="4849">It is essential to determine factors that prevent individuals with diabetes from receiving self-management education and support.</s> <s i="4850">The assessment process includes the identification of these barriers to access (32–34).</s> <s i="4851">These barriers may include the socioeconomic or cultural factors mentioned above, as well as, for example, health insurance shortfalls and the lack of encouragement from other health providers to seek diabetes education (35,36).</s>



<s i="4852">STANDARD 4



Program coordination

A coordinator will be designated to oversee the DSME program.</s> <s i="4853">The coordinator will have oversight responsibility for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of education services.</s>

<s i="4854">Coordination is essential to ensure that quality diabetes self-management education and support is delivered through an organized, systematic process (37,38).</s> <s i="4855">As the field of DSME continues to evolve, the coordinator plays a pivotal role in ensuring accountability and continuity in the education program (39–41).</s> <s i="4856">The coordinator’s role may be viewed as that of coordinating the program (or education process) and/or as supporting the coordination of the many aspects of selfmanagement in the continuum of diabetes and related conditions when feasible (42–49).</s> <s i="4857">This oversight includes designing an education program or service that helps the participant access needed resources and assists him or her in navigating the health care system (37,50–55).</s>

<s i="4858">The individual serving as the coordinator will have knowledge of the lifelong process of managing a chronic disease and facilitating behavior change, in addition to experience with program and/or clinical management (56–59).</s> <s i="4859">In some cases, particularly in solo or other small practices, the coordinator may also provide DSME and/ or DSMS.</s>



<s i="4860">STANDARD 5



Instructional staff

One or more instructors will provide DSME and, when applicable, DSMS.</s> <s i="4861">At least one of the instructors responsible for designing and planning DSME and DSMS will be a registered nurse, registered dietitian, or pharmacist with training and experience pertinent to DSME, or another professional with certification in diabetes care and education, such as a CDE or BC-ADM.</s> <s i="4862">Other health workers can contribute to DSME and provide DSMS with appropriate training in diabetes and with supervision and support.</s>

<s i="4863">Historically, nurses and dietitians were the main providers of diabetes education (3,4,60–64).</s> <s i="4864">In recent years, the role of the diabetes educator has expanded to other disciplines, particularly pharmacists (65– 67).</s> <s i="4865">Reviews comparing the effectiveness of different disciplines for education have not identified clear differences in the quality of services delivered by different professionals (3–5).</s> <s i="4866">However, the literature favors the registered nurse, registered dietitian, and pharmacist serving both as the key primary instructors for diabetes education and as members of the multidisciplinary team responsible for designing the curriculum and assisting in the delivery of DSME (1–7,68).</s> <s i="4867">Expert consensus supports the need for specialized diabetes and educational training beyond academic preparation for the primary instructors on the diabetes team (69–72).</s> <s i="4868">Professionals serving as instructors must document appropriate continuing education or comparable activities to ensure their continuing competence to serve in their instructional, training, and oversight roles (73).</s>

<s i="4869">Reflecting the evolving health care environment, a number of studies have endorsed a multidisciplinary team approach to diabetes care, education, and support.</s> <s i="4870">The disciplines that may be involved include, but are not limited to, physicians, psychologists and other mental health specialists, physical activity specialists (including physical therapists, occupational therapists, and exercise physiologists), optometrists, and podiatrists (68,74,75).</s> <s i="4871">More recently, health educators (e.g., Certified Health Education Specialists and Certified Medical Assistants), case managers, lay health and community workers (76–83), and peer counselors or educators (84,85) have been shown to contribute effectively as part of the DSME team and in providing DSMS.</s> <s i="4872">While DSME and DSMS are often provided within the framework of a collaborative and integrated team approach, it is crucial that the individual with diabetes is viewed as central to the team and that he or she takes an active role.</s>

<s i="4873">Certification as a diabetes educator (CDE) by the National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators (NCBDE) is one way a health professional can demonstrate mastery of a specific body of knowledge, and this certification has become an accepted credential in the diabetes community (86).</s> <s i="4874">An additional credential that indicates specialized training beyond basic preparation is board certification in Advanced Diabetes Management (BC-ADM) offered by the AADE, which is available for nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, physicians, and physician assistants (68,74,87).</s>

<s i="4875">Individuals who serve as lay health and community workers and peer counselors or educators may contribute to the provision of DSME instruction and provide DSMS if they have received training in diabetes management, the teaching of selfmanagement skills, group facilitation, and emotional support.</s> <s i="4876">For these individuals, a system must be in place that ensures supervision of the services they provide by a diabetes educator or other health care professional and professional back-up to address clinical problems or questions beyond their training (88–90).</s>

<s i="4877">For services outside the expertise of any provider(s) of DSME and DSMS, a mechanism must be in place to ensure that the individual with diabetes is connected with appropriately trained and credentialed  providers.</s>



<s i="4878">STANDARD 6



Curriculum

A written curriculum reflecting current evidence and practice guidelines, with criteria for evaluating outcomes, will serve as the framework for the provision of DSME.</s> <s i="4879">The needs of the individual participant will determine which parts of the curriculum will be provided to that individual.</s>

<s i="4880">Individuals with prediabetes and diabetes and their families and caregivers have much to learn to become effective self-managers of their condition.</s> <s i="4881">DSME can provide this education via an up-todate, evidence-based, and flexible curriculum (8,91).</s>

<s i="4882">The curriculum is a coordinated set of courses and educational experiences.</s> <s i="4883">It also specifies learning outcomes and effective teaching strategies (92,93).</s> <s i="4884">The curriculum must be dynamic and reflect current evidence and practice guidelines (93–97).</s> <s i="4885">Recent education research endorses the inclusion of practical problemsolving approaches, collaborative care, psychosocial issues, behavior change, and strategies to sustain self-management efforts (12,13,19,74,86,98–101).</s>

<s i="4886">The following core topics are commonly part of the curriculum taught in comprehensive programs that have demonstrated successful outcomes (2,3,5,91,102–104):



c Describing the diabetes disease process and treatment options

c Incorporating nutritional management into lifestyle

c Incorporating physical activity into lifestyle

c Using medication(s) safely and for maximum therapeutic effectiveness

c Monitoring blood glucose and other parameters and interpreting and using the results  for  self-management decision making

c Preventing, detecting, and treating acute  complications

c Preventing, detecting, and treating chronic complications

c Developing personal strategies to address psychosocial issues and concerns

c Developing personal strategies to promote health and behavior change



While the content areas listed above provide a solid outline for a diabetes education and support curriculum, it is crucial that the content be tailored to match each individual’s needs and be adapted as necessary for age, type of diabetes (including prediabetes and diabetes in pregnancy), cultural factors, health literacy and numeracy, and comorbidities (14,105–108).</s> <s i="4887">The content areas will be able to be adapted for all practice settings.</s>
<s i="4888">Approaches to education that are interactive and patient centered have been shown to be effective (12,13,109–112).</s> <s i="4889">Also crucial is the development of action-oriented behavioral goals and objectives (12– 14,113).</s> <s i="4890">Creative, patient-centered, experience-based delivery methodsdbeyond the mere acquisition of knowledgedare effective for supporting informed decision making and meaningful behavior change and addressing psychosocial concerns (114,115).</s>



<s i="4891">STANDARD 7

Individualization

The diabetes self-management, education, and support needs of each participant will be assessed by one or more instructors.</s> <s i="4892">The participant and instructor(s) will then together develop an individualized education and support plan focused on behavior change.</s>

<s i="4893">Research has demonstrated the importance of individualizing diabetes education to each participant’s needs (116).</s> <s i="4894">The assessment process is used to identify what those needs are and to facilitate the selection of appropriate educational and behavioral interventions and selfmanagement support strategies, guided by evidence (2,63,116–118).</s> <s i="4895">The assessment must garner information about the individual’s medical history, age, cultural influences, health beliefs and attitudes, diabetes knowledge, diabetes self-management skills and behaviors, emotional response to diabetes, readiness to learn, literacy level (including health literacy and numeracy), physical limitations, family support, and financial status (11,106,108,117,119–128).</s>

<s i="4896">The education and support plan that the participant and instructor(s) develop will be rooted in evidence-based approaches to effective health communication and education while taking into consideration participant barriers, abilities, and expectations.</s> <s i="4897">The instructor will use clear health communication principles, avoiding jargon, making information culturally relevant, using languageand literacyappropriate education materials, and using interpreter services when indicated (107,129–131).</s> <s i="4898">Evidence-based communication strategies such as collaborative goal setting, motivational interviewing, cognitive behavior change strategies, problem solving, self-efficacy enhancement, and relapse prevention strategies are also effective (101,132–134).</s> <s i="4899">Periodic reassessment can determine whether there is need for additional or different interventions and future reassessment (6,72,134–137).</s> <s i="4900">A variety of assessment modalities, including telephone follow-up and other information technologies (e.g., Web based, text messaging, or automated phone calls), may augment face-to-face assessments (72,87,138–141).</s>

<s i="4901">The assessment and education plan, intervention,  and  outcomes  will  be documented in the education/health record.</s> <s i="4902">Documentation of participant encounters will guide the education process, provide evidence of communication among instructional staff and other members of the participant’s health care team, prevent duplication of services, and demonstrate adherence to guidelines (117,135,142,143).</s> <s i="4903">Providing information to other members of the participant’s health care team through documentation of educational objectives and personal behavioral goals increases the likelihood that all the members will work in collaboration (86,143).</s> <s i="4904">Evidence suggests that the development of standardized procedures for documentation, training health professionals to document appropriately, and the use of structured standardized forms based on current practice guidelines can improve documentation and may ultimately improve quality of care (135,143–145).</s>

<s i="4905">STANDARD 8

Ongoing support

The participant and instructor(s) will together develop a personalized follow-up plan for ongoing self-management support.</s> <s i="4906">The participant’s outcomes and goals and the plan for ongoing self-management support will be communicated to other members of the health care team.</s>

<s i="4907">While DSME is necessary and effective, it does not in itself guarantee a lifetime of effective diabetes self-care (113).</s> <s i="4908">Initial improvements in participants’ metabolic and other outcomes have been found to diminish after approximately 6 months (3).</s> <s i="4909">To sustain the level of self-management needed to effectively manage prediabetes and diabetes over the long term, most participants need ongoing DSMS (15).</s>

<s i="4910">The type of support provided can be behavioral, educational, psychosocial, or clinical (11–14).</s> <s i="4911">A variety of strategies are available for providing DSMS both within and outside the DSME organization.</s> <s i="4912">Some patients benefit from working with a nurse case manager (6,86,146).</s> <s i="4913">Case management for DSMS can include reminders about needed follow-up care and tests, medication management, education, behavioral goal setting, psychosocial support, and connection to community resources.</s>

<s i="4914">The effectiveness of providing DSMS through disease management programs, trained peers and community health workers, community-based programs, information technology, ongoing education, support  groups,  and  medical  nutrition therapy has also been established (7– 11,86,88–90,142,147–150).</s>

<s i="4915">While the primary responsibility for diabetes education belongs to the provider(s) of DSME, participants benefit by receiving reinforcement of content and behavioral goals from their entire health careteam (135).</s> <s i="4916">Additionally, many patients receive DSMS through their primary care provider.</s> <s i="4917">Thus, communication among the team regarding the patient’s educational outcomes, goals, and DSMS plan is essential to ensure that people with diabetes receive support that meets their needs and is reinforced and consistent among the health care team members.</s>

<s i="4918">Because self-management takes place in participants’ daily lives and not in clinical or educational settings, patients will be assisted to formulate a plan to find community-based resources that may support their ongoing diabetes selfmanagement.</s> <s i="4919">Ideally, DSME and DSMS providers will work with participants to identify such services and, when possible, track those that have been effective with patients, while communicating with providers of community-based resources in order to better integrate them into patients’ overall care and ongoing support.</s>

<s i="4920">STANDARD 9

Patient progress

The provider(s) of DSME and DSMS will monitor whether participants are achieving their personal diabetes self-management goals and other outcome(s) as a way to evaluate the effectiveness of the educational intervention(s), using appropriate measurement techniques.</s>

<s i="4921">Effective diabetes self-management can be a significant contributor to long-term, positive health outcomes.</s> <s i="4922">The provider(s) of DSME and DSMS will assess each participant’s personal self-management goals and his or her progress toward those goals (151,152).</s>

<s i="4923">The AADE Outcome Standards for Diabetes Education specify behavior change as the key outcome and provide a useful framework for assessment and documentation.</s> <s i="4924">The AADE7 lists seven essential factors: physical activity, healthy eating, taking medication, monitoring blood glucose, diabetes self-care–related problem solving, reducing risks of acute and chronic complications, and psychosocial aspects of living with diabetes (93,153,154).</s> <s i="4925">Differences in behaviors, health beliefs, and culture as well as their emotional response to diabetes can have a significant impact on how participants understand their illness and engage in self-management.</s> <s i="4926">DSME providers who account for these differences when collaborating with participants on the design of personalized DSME or DSMS programs can   improve   participant   outcomes (147,148).</s>
<s i="4927">Assessments of participant outcomes must occur at appropriate intervals.</s> <s i="4928">The interval depends on the nature of the outcome itself and the time frame specified based on the participant’s personal goals.</s> <s i="4929">For some areas, the indicators, measures, and time frames will be based on guidelines from professional organizations or government agencies.</s>

<s i="4930">STANDARD 10

Quality improvement

The provider(s) of DSME will measure the effectiveness of the education and support and look for ways to improve any identified gaps in services or service quality using a systematic review of process and outcome data.</s>

<s i="4931">Diabetes education must be responsive to advances in knowledge, treatment strategies, education strategies, and psychosocial interventions, as well as consumer trends and the changing health care environment.</s> <s i="4932">By measuring and monitoring both process and outcome data on an ongoing basis, providers of DSME can identify areas of improvement and make adjustments in participant engagement strategies and program offerings accordingly.</s>

<s i="4933">The Institute for Healthcare Improvement suggests three fundamental questions that should be answered by an improvement process (149):



c   What are we trying to accomplish?</s>

<s i="4934">•   How will we know a change is an improvement?</s>

<s i="4935">•   What changes can we make that will result in an improvement?</s>



<s i="4936">Once areas for improvement are identified, the DSME provider must designate timelines and important milestones including data collection, analysis, and presentation of results (150).</s> <s i="4937">Measuring both processes and outcomes helps to ensure that change is successful without causing additional problems in the system.</s> <s i="4938">Outcome measures indicate the result of a process (i.e., whether changes are actually leading to improvement), while process measures provide information about what caused those results (144,150).</s> <s i="4939">Process measures are often targeted to those processes that typically impact the most important outcomes.</s>
