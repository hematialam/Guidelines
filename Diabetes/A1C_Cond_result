 Condition if 2: implemented soon after the diagnosis of diabetes is associated with long-term reduction in macrovascular disease  Action: Glycemic goals in adults • Lowering A1C to below or around 7 % has been shown to reduce microvascular complications of diabetes , and 
 Condition if 2: this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment  Action: • Providers might reasonably suggest more stringent A1C goals -LRB- such as < 6.5 % -RRB- for selected individual patients , 
 Condition if 1: noninsulin monotherapy at maximal tolerated dose does not achieve or maintain the A1C target over 3 -- 6 months  Action: add a second oral agent , a glucagon-like peptide-1 -LRB- GLP-1 -RRB- receptor agonist , or insulin 
 Condition if 2: the result of testing in the previous 2 -- 3 months is not available  Action: • Consider obtaining an A1C on patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital 
 Condition when 1: matched for FPG  Action: African Americans -LRB- with and without diabetes -RRB- indeed had higher A1C than whites , but also had higher levels of fructosamine and glycated albumin and lower levels of 1,5 anhydroglucitol , suggesting that their glycemic burden -LRB- particularly postprandially -RRB- may be higher -LRB- 9 -RRB- 
 Condition if 1: the A1C is 7.0 % and a repeat result is 6.8 %  Action: the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed 
 Condition if 1: two different tests -LRB- such as A1C and FPG -RRB- are both above the diagnostic thresholds  Action: the diagnosis of diabetes is also confirmed 
 Condition if 1: a patient meets the diabetes criterion of the A1C -LRB- two results > = 6.5 % -RRB- but not the FPG -LRB- < 126 mg / dL or 7.0 mmol/L -RRB-  Action: or vice versa , that person should be considered to have diabetes 
 Condition if 1: results not available within past 2 -- 3 months If not performed/available within past year • Fasting lipid profile  Action: including total , LDL and HDL cholesterol and triglycerides • Liver function tests • Test for urine albumin excretion with spot urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio • Serum creatinine and calculated GFR • TSH in type 1 diabetes , dyslipidemia or women over age 50 years Referrals • Eye care professional for annual dilated eye exam • Family planning for women of reproductive age • Registered dietitian for MNT • DSME • Dentist for comprehensive periodontal examination • Mental health professional , if needed * See appropriate referrals for these categories 
 Condition when 2: a clinician orders the A1C test  Action: The ADA and the American Association for Clinical Chemistry have determined that the correlation -LRB- r = 0.92 -RRB- is strong enough to justify reporting both an A1C result and an estimated average glucose -LRB- eAG -RRB- result 
 Condition if 2: implemented soon after the diagnosis of diabetes is associated with long-term reduction in macrovascular disease  Action: Glycemic goals in adults Recommendations • Lowering A1C to below or around 7 % has been shown to reduce microvascular complications of diabetes and 
 Condition if 2: this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment  Action: • Providers might reasonably suggest more stringent A1C goals -LRB- such as < 6.5 % -RRB- for selected individual patients , 
 Condition if 1: they can be achieved without excessive hypoglycemia : • premeal  Action: bedtime , and overnight glucose 60 -- 99 mg/dL -LRB- 
 Condition if 1: A1C goals are no t me t de sp i te re a c hi ng pr e pr a nd ia l g lu c os e go a ls † Postprandial glucose measurements should be made 1 -- 2 h after the beginning of the meal  Action: generally peak levels in patients with diabetes 
 Condition if 1: noninsulin monotherapy at maximal tolerated dose does not achieve or maintain the A1C target over 3 -- 6 months  Action: add a second oral agent , a glucagon-like peptide-1 -LRB- GLP-1 -RRB- receptor agonist , or insulin 
 Condition when 2: a registered dietitian provided follow-up visits ranging from monthly to 3 sessions per year -LRB- 115 -- 122 -RRB-  Action: Multiple studies have demonstrated sustained improvements in A1C at 12 months and longer 
 Condition if 2: it can be School age -LRB- 6 -- 12 -RRB- 90 -- 180 100 -- 180 < 8 % achieved without excessive hypoglycemia • Vulnerability of hypoglycemia c A lower goal -LRB- ,7.5 % -RRB- is reasonable if it can be Adolescents and young adults -LRB- 13 -- 19 -RRB- 90 -- 130 90 -- 150 < 7.5 % achieved without excessive hypoglycemia • A lower goal -LRB- ,7.0 % -RRB- is reasonable if it can be achieved without excessive hypoglycemia Key concepts in setting glycemic goals : • Goals should be individualized and lower goals may be reasonable based on benefit-risk assessment  Action: Table 15 Plasma blood glucose and A1C goals for type 1 diabetes by age-group Plasma blood glucose goal range -LRB- mg/dL -RRB- Values by age -LRB- years -RRB- Before meals Bedtime / overnight A1C Rationale Toddlers and preschoolers -LRB- 0 -- 6 -RRB- 100 -- 180 110 -- 200 < 8.5 % c Vulnerability to hypoglycemia c Insulin sensitivity c Unpredictability in dietary intake and physical activity c A lower goal -LRB- ,8.0 % -RRB- is reasonable 
 Condition when 2: there is a discrepancy between preprandial blood glucose values and A1C levels and to help assess glycemia in those on basal/bolus regimens  Action: c Postprandial blood glucose values should be measured 
 Condition if 2: the result of testing in the previous 2 -- 3 months is not available  Action: • Consider obtaining an A1C on patients with diabetes admitted to the hospital 
 Condition when 1: recommending the use of the A1C to diagnose diabetes in its 2009 report  Action: the International Expert Committee -LRB- 3 -RRB- stressed the continuum of risk for diabetes with all glycemic measures and did not formally identify an equivalent intermediate category for A1C 
 Condition if 1: the A1C is 7.0 % and a repeat result is 6.8 %  Action: the diagnosis of diabetes is confirmed 
 Condition if 1: a patient meets the diabetes criterion of the A1C -LRB- two results > = 6.5 % -RRB- but not the FPG -LRB- ,126 mg/dl or 7.0 mmol/l -RRB-  Action: or vice versa , that person should be considered to have diabetes 
 Condition when 2: glycemic excursions are occurring and which facet of the diabetes regimen is changing  Action: Discrepancies between CBG monitoring results and A1C may indicate a hemoglobinopathy , hemolysis , or need for evaluation of CBG monitoring technique and equipment or initiation of more frequent CBG monitoring to identify 
 Condition if 1: the receiving facility is responsible for transporting the patient to that appointment • name and telephone/fax number of a contact person at the transferring facility who can provide additional information  Action: if needed The medical transfer summary , which acts as a quick medical reference for the receiving facility , should be transferred along with the patient 
 Condition when 2: using a glucose meter or recording a fasting glucose value on a lab report -LRB- 5 -RRB-  Action: Estimated average glucose -LRB- eAG -RRB- is directly related to A1C and also provides an individual with an estimate of average blood glucose over a period of time , but it uses the same values and units that are observed
