 Condition if 2: not detected early and treated appropriately  Action: Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction , stroke , renal failure , and death 
 Condition if 2: they met the above criteria  Action: Additionally , all panel members were asked to identify newly published studies for consideration 
 Condition if 2: rated as good or fair  Action: Studies selected were rated for quality using NHLBI 's standardized quality rating tool -LRB- see Supplement -RRB- and were only included 
 Condition if 1: pharmacologic treatment for high BP results in lower achieved SBP -LRB- eg  Action: < 140 mm Hg -RRB- and treatment is well tolerated and without adverse effects on health or quality of life , treatment does not need to be adjusted 
 Condition if 1: goal BP is not reached within a month of treatment  Action: increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug from one of the classes in recommendation 6 -LRB- thiazide-type diuretic , CCB , ACEI , or ARB -RRB- 
 Condition if 1: goal BP can not be reached with 2 drugs  Action: add and titrate a third drug from the list provided 
 Condition if 1: goal BP can not be reached using only the drugs in recommendation 6 because of a contraindication or the need to use more than 3 drugs to reach goal BP  Action: antihypertensive drugs from other classes can be used 
 Condition if 1: pharmacologic treatment for high BP results in lower achieved SBP -LRB- for example  Action: < 140 mm Hg -RRB- and treatment is not associated with adverse effects on health or quality of life , treatment does not need to be adjusted 
 Condition if 2: treatment results in SBP lower than 140 mm Hg and is not associated with adverse effects on health or quality of life  Action: Therefore , the panel included a corollary recommendation based on expert opinion that treatment for hypertension does not need to be adjusted 
 Condition if 1: there is a benefit in mortality  Action: or cardiovascular or cerebrovascular health outcomes with antihypertensive drug therapy to a lower BP goal -LRB- for example , < 130/80 mm Hg -RRB- compared with a goal of lower than 140/90 mm Hg -LRB- question 2 , evidence statement 15 -RRB- 
 Condition when 1: weighing the risks and benefits of a lower BP goal for people aged 70 years or older with estimated GFR less than 60 mL/min/1 .73 m2  Action: antihypertensive treatment should be individualized , taking into consideration factors such as frailty , comorbidities , and albuminuria 
 Condition if 1: the benefits were due to lowering SBP  Action: DBP , or both 
 Condition when 1: selecting a drug for initial therapy for hypertension  Action: the panel did not conclude that it was compelling enough within the context of the overall body of evidence to preclude the use of the other drug classes for initial therapy 
 Condition if 2: the person is black and has CKD  Action: The panel noted the potential conflict between this recommendation to use an ACEI or ARB in those with CKD and hypertension and the recommendation to use a diuretic or CCB -LRB- recommendation 7 -RRB- in black persons : what 
 Condition if 1: an ACEI or ARB is not used as the initial drug  Action: then an ACEI or ARB can be added as a second-line drug if necessary to achieve goal BP 
 Condition if 1: goal BP is not reached within a month of treatment  Action: increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug from one of the classes in recommendation 6 -LRB- thiazide-type diuretic , CCB , ACEI , or ARB -RRB- 
 Condition if 1: goal BP can not be reached with 2 drugs  Action: add and titrate a third drug from the list provided 
 Condition if 1: goal BP can not be reached using the drugs in recommendation 6 because of a contraindication or the need to use more than 3 drugs to reach goal BP  Action: antihypertensive drugs from other classes can be used 
 Condition if 1: one of the strategies results in improved cardiovascular outcomes  Action: cerebrovascular outcomes , kidney outcomes , or mortality compared with an alternative strategy 
 Condition if 2: it is perceived not to be effective or if there are adverse effects  Action: Finally , panel members point out that in specific situations , one antihypertensive drug may be replaced with another 
 Condition when 1: the overall risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was substantially higher than it is today ; therefore  Action: effect sizes may have been overestimated 
 Condition when 1: the panel made its decisions  Action: the review was not designed to determine whether therapy-associated adverse effects and harms resulted in significant changes in important health outcomes
