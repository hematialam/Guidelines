 Condition when 1: control is good -LRB- see Figures 4  Action: 5 & 6 for summaries of stepwise management in adults and children -RRB- 
 Condition if 2: there are problems in obtaining consistent drug delivery  Action: In children under 5 years , higher doses may be required 
 Condition when 2: taken twice rather than once daily  Action: Current inhaled steroids are slightly more effective 
 Condition if 2: good control is established  Action: A D D Once a day inhaled steroids at the same total daily dose can be considered -LRB- within product licence -RRB- 
 Condition when 2: assessing systemic risk  Action: Account should be taken of other topical steroid therapy 
 Condition when 2: changing between BDP and budesonide  Action: However , at present a 1:1 ratio should be assumed 
 Condition if 2: there is no response to treatment the drug should be discontinued  Action: 
 Condition if 1: , as may happen occasionally  Action: there is no response to inhaled long-acting beta2 agonist , stop the LABA and increase the dose of inhaled steroid to 800 mcg/day -LRB- adults -RRB- or 400 mcg/day -LRB- children -RRB- if not already on this dose 
 Condition if 1: there is a response to LABA  Action: but control remains poor , continue with the LABA and increase the dose of inhaled steroid to 800 mcg/day -LRB- adults -RRB- or 400 mcg/day -LRB- children 5-12 years -RRB- 
 Condition if 2: asthma control remains sub-optimal after the addition of an inhaled long-acting beta2 agonist then the dose of inhaled steroids should be increased to 800 mcg/day in adults or 400 mcg/day in children -LRB- 5-12 years -RRB-  Action: D D X 
 Condition if 1: control is still inadequate after a trial of LABA and after increasing the dose of inhaled steroid  Action: consider a sequential trial of add-on therapy , 
 Condition if 1: a trial of an add-on treatment is ineffective  Action: stop the drug -LRB- or in the case of increased dose of inhaled steroid , reduce to the original dose -RRB- 
 Condition if 1: possible  Action: to stop long-term steroid tablets completely 
 Condition if 2: required  Action: In adults , the recommended method of eliminating or reducing the dose of steroid tablets is inhaled steroids , at doses of up to 2000 mcg/day 
 Condition if 1: no improvement in steroid dose  Action: symptoms or lung function is detected 
 Condition when 1: deciding which drug to step down first and at what rate  Action: the severity of asthma , the side-effects of the treatment , the beneficial effect achieved , and the patient 's preference should all be taken into account
