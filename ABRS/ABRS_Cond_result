 Condition if 1: symptoms worsen after 48 -- 72 hours of initial empiric antimicrobial therapy or fail to improve despite 3 -- 5 days of initial empiric antimicrobial therapy -LRB- strong  Action: moderate -RRB- 
 Condition when 2: should referral to a specialist be considered in the management of a patient with presumed ABRS  Action: 
 Condition when 2: actually the bacteria recovered represent contaminants derived from the nose -RRB-  Action: Failure to adequately decontaminate the paranasal mucosa during sinus aspiration or to quantify any bacterial isolates in the aspirate are the most common pitfalls that may lead to misinterpretation of results -LRB- ie , assuming the presence of infection 
 Condition if 1: fever is present  Action: it tends to be present early in the illness , often in concert with other constitutional symptoms such as headache and myalgia 
 Condition when 2: in fact they may not have ABRS at all  Action: The finding that approximately 65 % of placebo-treated patients improved spontaneously in these studies may lead to an erroneous conclusion that some patients with ABRS do not require antimicrobial therapy , 
 Condition if 2: more of the study patients actually had ABRS  Action: One can only surmise that the benefit of antimicrobial therapy would have been substantially magnified 
 Condition if 2: available  Action: The practice of evidence-based medicine requires that clinical decisions regarding the selection of empiric antimicrobial therapy for ABRS be supported by RCTs 
 Condition when 2: inappropriate antimicrobial therapy was administered to patients with ABRS caused by H. influenzae on the basis of posttreatment sinus puncture studies -LSB- 12 -RSB-  Action: Similar data exist 
 Condition if 2: one can be confident that the desired benefits clearly outweigh the undesirable consequences  Action: High-quality evidence does not necessarily constitute strong recommendations , and conversely , strong recommendations can still arise from low-quality evidence 
 Condition if 1: the magnitude of the treatment effect is very large  Action: if there is evidence of a dose -- response relation , or if all plausible biases would decrease the magnitude of an apparent treatment effect 
 Condition if 1: applicable  Action: on additional studies published after the reviews were done 
 Condition when 1: no systematic review was available  Action: we evaluated the original studies to inform judgments about the quality of the underlying evidence from a crude examination of these studies 
 Condition if 1: necessary  Action: the entire panel will reconvene to discuss potential changes 
 Condition when 1: appropriate  Action: the panel will recommend full revision of the guideline to the IDSA Standards and Practice Guidelines Committee and the IDSA Board for review and approval 
 Condition when 1: more stringent inclusion criteria such as those outlined in recommendation 1 were employed  Action: Wald et al -LSB- 61 -RSB- reported a considerably lower spontaneous improvement rate of only 32 % at 14 days in children receiving placebo , compared with 64 % in those treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate , giving an NNT of 3 -LRB- 95 % CI , 
 Condition if 2: one is uncertain about the diagnosis of ABRS owing to mild symptoms but can not be recommended when more stringent clinical criteria for the diagnosis of ABRS are applied  Action: Thus , a watchful waiting strategy is only reasonable 
 Condition if 2: there is still no improvement  Action: Such patients require close observation ; antimicrobial therapy should be initiated promptly after 3 days 
 Condition when 2: both the prevalence of H. influenzae -LRB- 33 % -RRB- and the proportion of Î²-lactamase -- producing H. influenzae -LRB- 18 % -RRB- were relatively low -LSB- 30 -RSB-  Action: Although earlier studies that compared amoxicillin to amoxicillin-clavulanate did not find a superior outcome with amoxicillin-clavulanate -LSB- 62 , 64 -RSB- , these studies were performed in an era 
 Condition if 1: an oral cephalosporin is to be used  Action: a third-generation cephalosporin -LRB- eg , cefixime or cefpodoxime -RRB- in combination with clindamycin is recommended for patients with ABRS from geographic regions with high endemic rates of PNS 
 Condition if 1: an immunoglobulin E -- mediated immediate-type hypersensitivity response is documented  Action: a respiratory fluoroquinolone -LRB- levofloxacin , moxifloxacin -RRB- or doxycycline is recommended for adults 
 Condition when 1: the total numbers of enrolled patients are considered  Action: the recovery rate of 
 Condition if 1: only the studies that compared 5 days -LRB- short-course -RRB- vs 10 days -LRB- long-course -RRB- were included -LRB- 5 RCTs -RRB-  Action: adverse effects were significantly fewer in the short-course treatment groups -LRB- OR , 
 Condition when 2: antimicrobial therapy is not indicated  Action: These agents may still provide symptom relief in some patients with acute viral rhinosinusitis 
 Condition if 1: symptoms worsen after 48 -- 72 hours of initial empiric antimicrobial therapy  Action: or fail to improve despite 3 -- 5 days of initial empiric antimicrobial therapy -LRB- strong , moderate -RRB- 
 Condition if 1: symptoms and signs worsen despite 72 hours of initial empiric antimicrobial therapy  Action: the possible reasons for treatment failure must be considered , including resistant pathogens , structural abnormalities , or a nonbacterial cause 
 Condition if 1: there is no clinical improvement within 3 -- 5 days despite empiric antimicrobial therapy  Action: an alternate management strategy should be considered even though there is no clinical worsening 
 Condition if 2: treatment failure is suspected  Action: Careful clinical evaluation of the patient at 3 -- 5 days is critical to assess the response to empiric antimicrobial therapy and to consider alternative management options 
 Condition if 1: symptoms persist or worsen despite 72 hours of treatment with a second-line regimen  Action: referral to an otolaryngologist , allergist , or infectious disease specialist should be considered 
 Condition when 1: the maxillary sinus aspirate culture yielded a presumed sinus pathogen -LRB- ie  Action: 
 Condition when 2: suppurative complications are suspected  Action: In general , more advanced imaging modalities such as CT or MRI should be reserved for recurrent or complicated cases or 
 Condition if 2: multiple scans are obtained -LSB- 212 -RSB-  Action: CT scanning results in low levels of radiation exposure , which may lead to radiation-induced illnesses 
 Condition when 1: such patients fail to respond despite a change in antimicrobial therapy to broaden coverage for presumed bacterial resistance  Action: prompt referral to a specialist such as an otolaryngologist , allergist , or infectious disease specialist should be considered 
 Condition if 2: life-threatening complications are not recognized  Action: Delay in appropriate referral to specialists may prolong illness , result in chronic disease , and occasionally lead to catastrophic consequences 
 Condition if 2: chronic or recurrent symptoms severely affect the patient 's productivity or quality of life  Action: Timely referral is indicated
